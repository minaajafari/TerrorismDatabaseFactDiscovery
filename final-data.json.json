It did not say which country the soldiers were from, or give a more precise location of the attack.\n\nThe deaths brings to 14 the number of international troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year. Last year was the deadliest of the nearly decade-long war for international forces, with more than 700 killed, compared to just over 500 in 2009.\n\nThe NATO deaths came on a day when the Taliban struck at Afghan intelligence services, killing four people in a suicide bombing in the country\u2019s capital and another two in a roadside bombing in the eastern province of Kunar.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP\u2019s earlier story is below.\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - The Taliban took aim at Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence services Wednesday, killing six people and wounding more than 30 in two separate attacks, including a suicide bombing on a bus in the capital, officials said.\n\nThe attacks follow a surprise visit to Kabul a day earlier by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who praised advances made against the insurgency while noting that the gains were \u201cfragile and reversible.\u201d Biden left Afghanistan for neighboring Pakistan Wednesday morning.\n\nIn Kabul, a suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up next to a minibus carrying intelligence service employees to work, killing four people, President Hamid Karzai\u2019s office said. The Interior Ministry said the blast wounded 32 people, including six intelligence service members - although it spoke of only two people killed - one intelligence service member and a civilian. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.\n\nAbout an hour later in the troubled eastern province of Kunar, a remote-controlled roadside bomb killed an intelligence service colonel and his driver, and wounded two bodyguards, said Abdul Saboor Allahyar, deputy chief of Kunar\u2019s provincial police.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for both attacks.\n\nInsurgents often target Afghan security officials, although over the past few months the nation\u2019s capital has been largely spared the worst of the major attacks in the country.\n\nThe powerful blast in Kabul struck on a busy road during the morning rush-hour, shattering the windows of dozens of houses. The suicide bomber\u2019s body lay in the street near the wreckage of his motorbike as police and intelligence officials cordoned off the area.\n\nKarzai condemned the bombing, calling it \u201can act against humanity and against Islam.\u201d\n\nNATO also condemned the attack, saying it had killed at least one intelligence service member and one civilian, and wounded at least 32 people.\n\nThe Taliban has proven resilient in the face of the U.S.-led military coalition\u2019s nearly decade-long war. Although NATO poured more than 30,000 extra troops into the country last year to pressure the insurgents\u2019 traditional strongholds in the south, the Taliban have boosted their operations elsewhere, launching attacks across the north and east.\n\nAn extra contingent of 1,400 U.S. Marines are to be deployed in the coming months in the southern province of Helmand, which along with neighboring Kandahar have seen some of the fiercest fighting.\n\nNATO says its campaign so far has had a significant impact. The alliance\u2019s spokeswoman, Oana Lungescu, said that \u201cthousands of insurgent leaders have been killed or captured and several thousand fighters have been taken off the battlefield\u201d in the past year.\n\nLungescu described the guerrilla war as an \u201cindustrial strength\u201d insurgency, but disputed recent estimates from military and diplomatic officials at NATO headquarters that placed Taliban forces at up to 25,000 fighters. She called such estimates \u201chighly unreliable,\u201d and said focusing on the numerical strength of the Taliban misrepresents gains made by the alliance in the past year.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a single reliable source for the size of the insurgency. Numbers referred to a year ago were certainly based on best guess estimates at that time,\u201d Lungescu said in e-mailed comments, adding that estimates at the end of 2009 \u201cwere anywhere from 25,000 to 35,000.\u201d\n\nAfghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi said Wednesday that no official Afghan government figures were available, but he estimated the size of the Taliban was between 25,000 and 35,000 people.","1":"Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan \u2014  A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up Wednesday next to a minibus carrying members of Afghanistan\u2019s main intelligence service, killing at least two other people and injuring more than 30. It was the second bombing in the capital in eight days, a slight but worrying uptick in attacks in Kabul.\nAt almost the same time, a remote-controlled bomb killed the deputy intelligence chief and his driver in the eastern province of Kunar.\n\nThe dual attacks on intelligence officials coincided with a deadly day for Western troops in Afghanistan. Six members of the NATO force were killed by improvised bombs, five in the country\u2019s east, and one in the south. Their nationalities were not disclosed by the Western military, but Americans make up the bulk of troops in both those regions.\n\nAdding to the turmoil, a spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s attorney general said an investigation had been launched on possible wrongdoing at Kabul Bank, the nation\u2019s largest financial institution, which nearly collapsed last year and is now under the stewardship of the nation\u2019s central bank. Kabul Bank\u2019s major shareholders include a number of people close to President Hamid Karzai.\n\nThe Kabul explosion, which took place during morning rush hour on a crowded road in the western part of the city, came as Vice President Joe Biden was concluding a visit to Afghanistan. The vice president, who departed about 90 minutes after the blast, had traveled to an air base north of Kabul after meeting Karzai in the capital Tuesday.\n\nThe Taliban took responsibility for both bombings, and boasted that the one in Kabul had killed 14 people. It is not unusual for the movement to make exaggerated claims about an attack\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nThe head of the criminal investigation department for the Kabul police, Gen. Mohammad Zahir, identified the dead as an officer with the National Directorate of Security, the nation\u2019s premier intelligence service, and one civilian, in addition to the bomber. Six of the 32 injured were NDS personnel, he said, and the others were civilian bystanders.\n\nThe toll could rise, officials said, because at least two people suffered critical injuries.\n\nThe attack took place near the ruins of a former imperial palace, close to the city\u2019s main psychiatric hospital. Zahir noted that motorists usually try to avoid even honking their horns in the vicinity of the mental asylum, so as not to frighten or disturb the patients.\n\n\u201cBut the person who committed such a harrowing and brutal incident in front of the psychiatric hospital can\u2019t be counted as human,\u201d he said. Half a dozen people in the building, including patients and medical personnel, were hurt by flying glass, though none seriously.\n\nKarzai condemned the bombing, as did the U.S. Embassy and NATO\u2019s International Security Assistance Force.\n\nRecently, Western military officials had pointed to a drop-off in attacks in Kabul, and linked that decrease at least in part to the success of targeted strikes against the Haqqani network, a Taliban offshoot based in Pakistan\u2019s tribal area of North Waziristan. The Haqqanis were responsible for a number of spectacular attacks in the Afghan capital in 2008 and \u201909.\n\nBefore last week\u2019s bombing in Kabul, which killed a policeman, an attack in December on a military bus on the city\u2019s outskirts killed five Afghan army personnel. That was the first major strike in Kabul since May, when a suicide bomber attacked a convoy carrying senior Western military officials, killing 18 people. The dead in that strike included six members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization force, several of them high-ranking officers.\n\nIt was not clear whether the Kabul attack was planned as a strike against the intelligence service or the minibus was a target of opportunity. The Afghan intelligence services are thought to have played a significant role in pinpoint strikes by Western and Afghan troops against midlevel Taliban commanders, which the NATO force says have damaged the movement\u2019s command structure.","2":"KABUL, Afghanistan \u2013 A suicide bomber on a motorbike struck a minibus in the western part of the Afghan capital Wednesday, killing at least two people and wounding four, Interior Ministry spokesman Zemeri Bashary said.\n\nWitnesses said the bus was carrying intelligence service employees on their way to work, but Bashary would not confirm the target.\n\nThe powerful blast on a busy street during Kabul\u2019s early morning rush hour shattered the windows of dozens of houses and buildings nearby, while the bus and two private vehicles were damaged. The suicide bomber\u2019s body and his destroyed motorbike lay nearby.\n\nThe bombing broke a relative reprieve from major attacks inside the Afghan capital in the past few months.\n","3":"Kabul Finest supermarket hit by deadly bomb attackPublished28 January 2011Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingAt least eight people have been killed in a suicide attack at a supermarket popular with foreigners in the Afghan capital Kabul, officials say.The bomber opened fire in the store before detonating his explosives, said police and witnesses. Afghans and foreigners, including two women and a child, were among the dead, say reports. The Taliban told the BBC they had carried out the attack.The blast left the Finest store, not far from the British embassy, ablaze.The BBC's Quentin Sommerville, in Kabul, says the supermarket is located next to a busy roundabout and a police checkpoint, and like many stores in the Afghan capital it has armed guards.PanicA police officer, Nazamuddin, told the BBC: \"I was standing here when I suddenly heard a bang. After a few moments, I heard another bang. I didn't go inside to find out what's happened.\"The explosion in the heavily guarded Wazir Akbar Khan area of the city, an area frequented by foreigners and affluent Afghans, scattered debris across the road.A witness told the BBC: \"I was napping at my shop when I heard gun shots. Then we heard a loud explosion. Everyone was running around on the main road.''An officer with the National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan's spy agency, told the BBC that the guards had exchanged fire with the attacker for several minutes. Mary Hayden, a consultant who was in the shop, told the Associated Press news agency: \"To my left, I heard a gunshot. A bomb went off. Everyone was running to the back of the building.\"A Reuters news agency cameraman saw three dead bodies at the scene, including two women. \"We claim responsibility for the attack, and it was carried out at a time when foreigners were shopping, including the head of a security company,\" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid was quoted as telling Reuters.   Image caption, The blast in central Kabul left the supermarket ablazeA \"ring of steel\" erected around the capital before last September's parliamentary elections has failed to prevent militant attacks.   Earlier this month in Kabul, at least four people died when a suicide attacker rammed his motorcycle into a bus carrying security forces.   Violence in Afghanistan is at its worst level since the overthrow of the Taliban government in late 2001.US forces are due to begin withdrawing from the country in the middle of this year.","4":"KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide attack on a supermarket in Kabul\u2019s upmarket embassy district on Friday killed at least nine people, three of them foreign women, in the first major Taliban assault on civilians in the capital for nearly a year.A child was also among the dead from Friday\u2019s bombing, which shattered a sense of relative calm that had settled over the capital after nearly a year without an attack targeting foreign or Afghan civilians.\n\nGunfire rattled through the area -- home to the British, Canadian, Pakistani and other missions -- at the start of the assault, which one witness told police was launched by a man in his forties, with dark skin and a long beard.\n\nBodies were carried from the blackened hull of the \u201cFinest\u201d supermarket, popular with foreigners and several hundred yards from the British embassy, as fires broke out among shattered shelves and scattered food.

The blast heightened anxiety among the international community, which has been rattled in recent months by President Hamid Karzai\u2019s move to rein in private security firms, which provide protection to most foreign installations.\n\nThe explosion, the most serious attack in months in Kabul, was apparently caused by a suicide bomber, according to Gen. Mohammed Zahir, the head of criminal investigations with the Kabul police. The blast gutted the first floor of the grocery store, igniting small fires, shattering the storefront windows and tossing about canned goods and other food items. Smoke billowed into the air and bloodied victims staggered into the street.\n\nThe explosion shattered what had been a relative lull in attacks in the capital over the past year, although violence had been creeping up in recent weeks. Western military officials had attributed the slowdown in suicide bombings and other attacks in Kabul to an intense campaign by NATO forces targeting midlevel commanders belonging to the Taliban and to an offshoot, the Pakistan-based Haqqani network, which was blamed for a series of major attacks in the capital in the past three years.\n\nFriday is the main prayer day of the Muslim week, when many shops and businesses close.

The Taliban told the BBC they had carried out that attack.Monday's attack is thought to have begun when an attacker was challenged by security guards as he attempted to gain access to the shopping precinct, says the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul.The guards fired on the assailant, and the explosives he was carrying were detonated.\"It was a single blast,\" interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP news agency. \"A suicide bomber tried to enter the mall. He was stopped by the guards at the entrance, he blew himself up and killed the two armed private guards and injured two other people nearby,\" he said.Immediately after the blast there was an exchange of gunfire between insurgents and security forces that continued for up to 20 minutes, our correspondent says, but that has now ended and police have cordoned off the area.Image caption, A gun battle broke out in the centre of Kabul after the blastsUntil the attack on the supermarket at the end of January, our correspondent says, things had been less violent in Kabul - which some observers put down to an informal ceasefire operating between the main insurgent network and security forces.All of this is happening as the Afghan government -- with Nato sponsorship -- is trying to reach out to elements in the Taliban command who it is though might be ready to talk peace.

The blast killed four people.\n\nThe bicycle bomb went off almost at the same time as the one in Kabul, as a convoy of Afghan Shias drove down a road in another part of the country, shouting in celebration of the Shia Muslim holiday of Ashoura. The holiday marks the death of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nReligiously motivated attacks on Shias are rare in Afghanistan, although they are common in neighbouring Pakistan.

But he also warned the \"enemies of peace and stability in Afghanistan\" that the killings would be avenged.\n\n\"This attack is unacceptable,\" Haji Mohaqiq said. \"We will respond to this enemy attack. We will not forget this attack. We will have our revenge on our enemies.\"\n\nAsked who he thought was responsible for the violence, he answered: \"It is obvious it is Pakistan; Pakistan is always trying to carry out violent attacks in Afghanistan.\" The Hazaras, who are Shia Muslims, were treated harshly under the Taliban regime and were not allowed to observe religious holidays such as yesterday's.\n\nSince the hardline Sunni regime was ousted in 2001, sectarian attacks in Afghanistan have been rare. Such attacks, however, are common in Iraq and Pakistan.\n\nThe suicide bomb at the shrine produced the highest death toll in a single incident in Afghanistan since the blast at the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, which killed 60 people.\n\nThe site at the Abl Fazl shrine was sealed off by Afghan National Security Forces.

Dozens of bodies lay scattered around a dark patch on the road where the bomb had exploded.\n\nA Pakistani militant group with close ties to al-Qaida said it had carried out the attack, although security sources could not confirm the group's involvement. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Alami claimed responsibility in a phone call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station set up by Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty.\n\nThe Taliban were quick to condemn the bombing, the bloodiest single incident for Afghan civilians since 2008. Shia Muslims, who make up around 20% of the population, and other minorities suffered when the hardline Sunni movement was in power, but in recent times the Taliban have tried to portray themselves as a force for national unity.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the movement described the attacks as \"un-Islamic\" and blamed the \"invading enemy\", one of the terms they use to describe US-led Nato forces. They alleged foreigners were trying to foment unrest in order to extend the length of their stay in the country.\n\nThe Taliban have stretched credulity in the past by denying responsibility for attacks that have killed large numbers of civilians and outraged public opinion. But Martine van Bijlert, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, said this time the denial seemed plausible.\n\n\"It doesn't fit with what they have done in the past, unless it turns out that they, or a group or them, have quite fundamentally changed,\" she said.\n\nAlthough there is a long history of bomb attacks on Shias in neighbouring Pakistan, there has never been such a large-scale attack in Afghanistan, raising fears that radical outside groups are being drawn into the already complex and fragmented Afghan insurgency.\n\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Almi is a splinter group of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), which maintained training camps in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime but has not mounted attacks in the country in recent years. General Mohammad Zahir, the chief of Kabul CID, said he believed LeJ was involved in Tuesday's attack, although a LeJ operative in Pakistan told the Guardian his group was not involved.\n\nThe group has admitted atrocities in the past, including the killing of 29 Shia pilgrims on a bus in Pakistan's Baluchistan province in September. It is also believed to have been behind an attack on an Ashura procession in Karachi that killed 30 people in 2009.\n\nLeJ, whose operational leadership hides in Pakistan's tribal areas, is considered to be the Pakistani militant group closest to al-Qaida. It is also closely tied to the Pakistani Taliban.\n\n\"What is clear is that this is a new development in Afghanistan,\" said Van Bijlert. \"It is not part of the fault lines of the conflict that we are aware of. It looks designed to provoke sectarian or ethnic tensions.\"\n\nImmediately after the blast, armed police rushed to the scene, throwing a security cordon round the historic neighbourhood of Murad Khani, which is close to several government ministries.\n\nStunned and tearful locals milled around as loudspeakers still played recorded verses of the Qur'an.

There was no immediate explanation, but Afghan authorities had said late Sunday that they were trying to dislodge insurgents holed up in an empty building near the headquarters of NATO\u2019s International Security Assistance Force.\n\nInterior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said the remaining insurgents \u201chave no choice except surrendering or to be killed by the Afghan forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey came today with more than 20 insurgents and suicide bombers and attacked four provinces,\u201d Seddiqi told CNN Sunday. \u201cAs a result, they got nothing, and 19 of them were killed.\u201d\n\nThe assault was a rare occurrence in a heavily guarded part of Kabul \u2013 but Gen.

Two of the men planned to blow themselves up in Khalil\u2019s home, Mashal said.\n\nThe Taliban militia that once ruled most of Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying it launched fighters into battle with suicide vests, RPGs and hand grenades in Kabul and the provinces of Nangarhar, Paktia and Logar. But Mashal said the three men who targeted Khalil confessed to being members of the Haqqani network, a separate insurgent group that sometimes allies itself with the Taliban.\n\nIn his statement, Allen said, \u201cNo one is underestimating the seriousness of today\u2019s attacks.\u201d But ISAF spokesman Lt.

He suggested the attacks may be the work of the Haqqani network, rather than the Taliban, saying the Taliban did not have the capacity to carry them out.\n\nNATO\u2019s International Security Assistance Force said as many as seven locations in Kabul were attacked, including Afghanistan\u2019s parliament building and the American, German and Russian embassies.

A U.S. Army staff sergeant, Robert Bales, has been charged with those killings.\n\nBut Jeff Dressler, an expert on the Haqqani network at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, told CNN that the coordination seen in the Kabul attacks indicate a Haqqani-led network was behind them, and that planned but disrupted attacks in the north may also be Haqqani-linked.\n\n\u201cThis is likely their unofficial announcement marking the start of the spring fighting season,\u201d Dressler said. Though the attacks didn\u2019t succeed, he said, \u201cThe target selection was likely intended to send a message to the U.S., U.K., Russia and the Afghans that this will in fact be a bloody year for all forces in Afghanistan, particularly the east of the country.\u201d\n\nU.S. Embassy spokesman Gavin Sundwall said he could not confirm that the embassy itself was the target of the attacks, but said gunfire had been heard in the vicinity.

This was followed almost immediately by gunfire, with smoke seen rising from several buildings on a brisk spring day as sirens screamed. Heavy gunfire continued for at least 30 minutes after the initial blasts.\n\nMilitants in a tall building fired rockets in several directions, the Associated Press reported, with some apparently focused on the nearby British Embassy.

In Jalalabad, there were reports of four suicide attackers targeting the Jalalabad airfield housing U.S. troops. Local police said one blew himself up and three were intercepted.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the coordinated assault, which it said was part of its spring offensive involving dozens of suicide bombers in Kabul and three provinces around the nation equipped with suicide vests and rocket propelled grenades.\n\nThe coordinated attacks serve the Taliban\u2019s interests in at least two ways, analysts said. It aims to help push foreign troops out of the country before 2014, the announced date for NATO to hand over security to Afghan forces, knowing that foreign governments are increasingly weary of the war\u2019s cost in lost lives and money.\n\nAt another level, the Taliban is flexing its muscle for the political realignment likely to follow the withdrawal, choosing high-profile targets in the heart of the capital to intimidate and otherwise win over ordinary Afghans and showcase its ability to strike at will.","25":null,"26":"\tRadio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty","27":"A suicide car bomber has killed 12 people, nine of them foreigners, officials said, in an early-morning attack claimed by an armed group which said it sent a female attacker to avenge an anti-Islam film.\nA number of those killed on Tuesday were foreign workers for an international courier company, a senior police source said,\u00c2\u00a0and one\u00c2\u00a0was an Afghan translator.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153At around 6:45am [0215 GMT] a suicide bomber using a sedan blew himself up along the airport road in District 15.

Earlier this month, a Swedish journalist was shot on the street execution-style, and a Lebanese restaurant popular with foreigners was attacked by a suicide bomber and gunmen in January.\nThe attacks show the Taliban are following through on their threat to use violence to disrupt next month's elections.

Six others were injured.Four foreigners were also among the victims of the carefully planned assault, which was apparently aimed at undermining a vote now just two weeks away. Election monitors were among the Serena hotel's guests.It came days after a marketplace bomb killed 16 people in the north and just hours after a complex attack on a police headquarters in Jalalabad city claimed at least 18 lives. On Friday morning an attack in southern Kandahar killed three. The Taliban has vowed to disrupt the poll and said anyone who votes or works on the election is risking their life.\"This attack is connected to the election, our enemy is trying to sow uncertainty about our future,\" said Sediq Sediqqi, an interior ministry spokesman, at a news conference the morning after the assault on the hotel. \"They are threatening the security of the election, which is one of the biggest events in the history of Afghanistan.\"The gunmen launched their attack by opening fire in the Serena's popular buffet restaurant, which was packed with families and officials celebrating the start of the Afghan new year to live music.Afghan journalist Sardar Ahmad was killed in attacks by Taliban.

Fuck you terrorists you bloody killed my best friend with all his family,\" Parwiz Shamal, a journalist with TOLO, an Afghan television station, said on Twitter. The foreign victims were from New Zealand, Canada, India and Pakistan, said Sediqqi, but he did not release names or any other details.The attackers were armed only with six tiny handguns, barely bigger than cigarette packets, but shooting went on for over two hours as security forces hunted down the last attacker, who hid inside toilets at the sprawling hotel complex. Hundreds of staff and guests took refuge in a cavernous bunker, while others were evacuated from the building.The last person rescued, Sediqqi said, was the gunmen's first target. A senator who had been dining with three other legislators hurled glasses at the young attackers and escaped into a nearby garden where he hid for four hours, injured but alive. The other three all survived the attack unharmed.The Serena had been one of the few places in Afghanistan where both foreigners and the country's elite could relax and enjoy rare luxuries such as a swimming pool and 24-hour electricity. Tight layers of security including armed guards, multiple steel gates, metal detectors and x-ray machines made the five-star hotel feel safe even though it had been hit by an attack in 2008 that killed seven people.Thursday's attackers apparently hid handguns and bullets, wrapped in blue tissue paper and hidden under in the soles of their chunky shoes.They were all young men, with fake ID cards from southern Kandahar province with their ages given as between 19 and 25, although in pictures taken after the attack they looked barely out of their teens.They had told guards on the door that they were going to the restaurant for dinner, the interior ministry spokesman said, although the government is investigating why their guns were not discovered during security checks.The attack may drive some election monitors away. At least one mission was reportedly packing up just hours after the attack. Others said that while the deaths were tragic, violence was a risk in any country at war and they would continue with their mission.\"If you go to Afghanistan, a country where in the last year thousands of incidents have taken place, you cannot let yourself be influenced by the next incident,\" said Thijs Berman, a member of the European parliament and head of the EU election-monitoring mission.He added that his team had a commitment to millions of Afghans risking their lives to organise and participate in the vote. \"You have voters, you have civil servants, you have policemen and women, and thousands of people organising this election.

Do not leave any alive.\"\n\nHe said the gunmen spoke in Pashto - a language spoken mostly in the south and east of Afghanistan.\n\nThose who died followed a traditional Afghan Sufi strand of Islam which is hated by the Taliban, and also by fundamentalists from other mujahideen groups set up in the 1980s in the war against Russian occupation.\n\nSufism - or Islamic mysticism - was once suppressed by the Taliban but has returned in recent years.\n\nViolent attacks of this sort on mosques are very rare in Afghanistan.

Even though no casualties were reported, Afghanistan remained on high alert Sunday, Sediqqi said.The jihadist terrorist group has been stepping up attacks worldwide \u2013 and most recently in Afghanistan \u2013 while losing territory in its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe blast in Kabul on Saturday afternoon happened during a demonstration by members of the Hazara, a Shiite minority group, near the Afghan Parliament building and Kabul University. Declaring a national day of mourning Saturday evening, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani ordered flags in the nation to be flown at half-staff.The protesters were demanding a planned power line be rerouted through their poverty-stricken Bamyan province to ensure electricity in the relatively isolated area west of Kabul.\n\nAccounting for up to one-fifth of Afghanistan\u2019s population, Hazaras, a Persian-speaking people who mainly live in central Afghanistan, have long been branded outsiders for their Shia faith and far Asian features in the country dominated by followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, according to a 2008 National Georgraphic article.\n\nThe Hazara in the past have demanded the government protect them from attacks blamed on the Sunni Taliban and ISIS.\n\nProtesters in November march with coffins of  decapitated Hazaras in Kabul.\nProtesters in November march with coffins of decapitated Hazaras in Kabul.\nOn November 11, thousands of protesters marched through Kabul with coffins containing the decapitated bodies of seven Hazaras, four men, two women and one child.

If true, it would mark the first attack by Isis in Kabul, and its largest ever in Afghanistan.\n\nCrowds gather on the street in Kabul, Afghanistan for a massive anti-government protest.\nHazara people march on Kabul in power line protest\nRead more\nAccording to a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, 231 people were wounded, though this figure could rise.\n\nThe attack, the deadliest in Kabul since 2001, has raised fears of an intensification in sectarian conflict. Since Afghanistan\u2019s civil war in the 1990s the country has largely been spared the sectarian violence that plagues neighbouring Pakistan, as well as Iraq and Syria, where Isis has deliberately tried to stoke ethnic tensions.\n\n\nHazaras have historically suffered discrimination and persecution. The protesters were marching against government plans for a major power project to bypass Bamiyan, a predominantly Hazara province in the central highlands. Following similar protests in May, Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, established a commission to look into the issue but government attempts to find a compromise failed. On 19 June, a contract was signed to build a smaller electricity line through Bamiyan, which did not placate Hazara activists.\n\nIn the hours after the attack, details of casualties were unclear, but some security forces seemed to have been among the killed. As people were frantically calling friends present at the protests, calls went out on social media for blood donations to the city\u2019s poorly resourced hospitals. \u201cI was standing by the side of the crowd, behind an ice cream truck,\u201d said one protester, Aman Turkmani. When the blast happened, \u201cfirst the ice cream cart exploded, then he exploded. The sound of the explosion was very strong,\u201d he said.\n\nFemale Afghan protesters\nKabul\u2019s expat bubble used to be like Boogie Nights \u2013 now it\u2019s more like Panic Room\nRead more\nHours after the attack on Saturday, Amaq said Isis had sent two fighters with suicide belts to detonate among \u201ca Shia gathering\u201d. If confirmed, the attack would be the group\u2019s first against civilians in the Afghan capital. Kabul has become increasingly unnerved, particularly after another massive attack in April, which also killed 64 people. That attack was the deadliest in the capital since 2011.\n\nIsis has so far been concentrated in a few districts in Afghanistan\u2019s eastern provinces, where they have battled for turf with the Taliban. Their fighting force of 2,000-3,000 fighters is relatively small, but Saturday\u2019s attack is likely to stoke fears that Isis is gaining strength in the country. Most Afghans consider Isis to be an alien, extremist group, that is far more radical than the Taliban.\n\n\nGhani said in a statement: \u201cOpportunist terrorists went among the protesters and set off explosions that killed and wounded a number of our countrymen, including security and defence personnel.\u201d Leading Hazara representatives in the government had refused to endorse the protesters, accusing them of fuelling ethnic tension. Instead, the demonstration was led by grassroots activists and Karim Khalili, the country\u2019s former vice-president.\n\nAccording to a western official, the head of Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence service had earlier this week tried to persuade the protesters to cancel the event. The government deployed minimal security personnel to protect protesters, focusing instead on keeping them away from the city centre. At a previous demonstration, in late 2015, protesters who attempted to scale the wall of the presidential palace were shot at.\n\nOn Saturday, to keep the demonstration away from the palace, authorities blocked central roads, forcing protesters to gather at Deh Mazang Square, about two miles from the palace. To Hazaras, the power project is about more than electricity. A Shia minority making up an estimated 9% of the Afghan population, Hazaras have historically felt discriminated by the government and persecuted by insurgents.\n\nThe worst recent attack on Shias was in 2011 when twin blasts in Kabul and Mazar-i Sharif killed as many as 80 worshipers, most of them Hazaras who had gathered to commemorate the holy Shia day of Ashura. Hazaras have also been targeted in highway kidnappings, some of which have ended in killings of hostages. In 2015, seven relatives were kidnapped and beheaded by Islamists in Zabul province, sparking protests outside the presidential palace in demand for better protection of Hazaras.\n\nMany Afghan migrants and refugees who travel to Europe are Hazaras who argue for asylum on grounds of persecution. Bamiyan and Kabul, where Saturday\u2019s attack took place, are two out of three provinces, which the UK government deem safe enough to deport Afghans to.","67":"Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan \u2014  The extremist group Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing Saturday at a protest by members of the country\u2019s Hazara ethnic minority that killed at least 81 people, injured more than 230 others and turned a square in the Afghan capital into a tableau of carnage.\nIf verified, the claim from the Islamic State-affiliated Amaq News Agency would represent an ominous widening of the group\u2019s reach, which up until now had been mainly confined to a province bordering Pakistan. The Taliban issued a statement saying it was not involved.\n\nThe attack, among the most lethal since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, drew condemnation from the Obama administration, the United Nations mission in Afghanistan and the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in the country.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani, in a televised address, declared a day of mourning on Sunday.

The protesters had just started setting up tents in Kabul\u2019s Deh Mazang Square when an explosion ripped through the crowd.\n\nAccording to an Interior Ministry statement cited by local news reports, three suicide bombers targeted the rally. One failed to successfully detonate his explosives, and another was shot dead by security forces before he could do so.\n\nImages circulating on social media showed dozens of bodies and debris strewn across the area and people running frantically to escape.\n\nThe terror attacks you haven\u2019t heard about \u00bb\n\nRoadblocks set up to keep the protesters away from the presidential palace and other sensitive sites got in the way of ambulances that were attempting to reach the square, delaying the transfer of some of the injured to the hospital, witnesses said.\n\nKabul residents turned to Facebook to organize blood drives, posting updates about which hospitals were in need of donations.\n\nIslamic State has been active in Afghanistan since 2014 and is estimated to have between 2,000 and 3,000 fighters there, many of them disaffected members of the Taliban and Pakistani insurgent groups.\n\nAlthough the group has claimed responsibility for horrific attacks before, many of them directed against rival Taliban forces, it has until now largely confined its operations to parts of Nangarhar province.\n\nThis would mark the militants\u2019 first attack in the Afghan capital.

The attack was claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nAuthorities say another 231 people were wounded, some seriously, in the bombing Saturday afternoon on a march by members of the ethnic Hazara community, who are predominantly Shiite Muslim. Most Afghans are Sunni, and the IS group regards Shiites as apostates.\n\nThe attack was the first by IS on Kabul \u2014 and the capital\u2019s worst since a vicious Taliban insurgency began 15 years ago \u2014 raising concerns about the group\u2019s reach and capability in Afghanistan.\n\nBereaved families collected their dead from hospitals and morgues across the capital, and began digging graves as the first funerals went ahead in the west of the capital.\n\nMany people chose to bury their dead together with others \u2014 rather than in traditional family plots \u2014 encouraged by organizers of the Saturday demonstration, who call themselves the Enlighten Movement. In a hilltop graveyard in the Surkh Abad suburb of south-western Kabul, hundreds of people, most of them men, braved high winds and swirling dust to conduct the Shiite funeral rites.\n\nSimple wooden coffins covered in the green Shiite flag were carried by men on their shoulders and lowered into graves that relatives had dug themselves with shovels.\n\nIn the city\u2019s west, in Omaid-a-Sabz, the grieving chose to bury their dead side by side in long rows. Mullah Mohammad Hassan Rasat said the Hazara people felt a deep sense of injustice and anger that the government had not kept its election promise to ensure that development was equal for all Afghan ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cOur people only want justice and equal development for all,\u201d he said.\n\nHazaras account for up to 15 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population, estimated at around 30 million, and say they face discrimination. During the Taliban\u2019s 1996-2001 rule, the Hazaras were often brutally treated. The Taliban were quick to deny culpability for the Saturday attack, however, issuing a statement before IS claimed responsibility.\n\nThe Saturday attack has raised concerns about sectarianism, and the Interior Ministry announced a ban on public gatherings and demonstrations in an apparent bid to avoid any inter-communal strife. A presidential spokesman pointed out that the ban on public gatherings would not apply to the funerals for Saturday\u2019s victims.\n\nIS has had a presence in Afghanistan for the past year, mainly in the eastern province of Nangarhar along the Pakistani border. The Afghan military, backed by U.S. troops, is planning an offensive against IS positions in Nangarhar in coming days.\n\nPrior to the Saturday attack, thousands of Hazaras had marched through Kabul to demand the rerouting of a power line through their impoverished province of Bamiyan, in the central highlands. It was their second demonstration; the first was in May with a much better turnout and attended by senior Hazara politicians, who were absent from Saturday\u2019s march.\n\nThe office of President Ashraf Ghani said that march organizers had been warned to call off the demonstration after intelligence was received that an attack was likely.\n\nDaud Naji, an Enlighten Movement leader, said on Sunday that they had been told only that there was a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of attack and had subsequently cancelled nine of 10 planned routes.\n\nOn Sunday, Ghani attended a memorial prayer service in a mosque on the grounds of the presidential palace, his spokesman Haroon Chakhansuri said.\n\nThe office of the United Nations assistance mission in Afghanistan issued a statement conveying its \u201cdeepest condolences and solidarity\u201d and noting that people of all ethnicities across the country were still queueing at hospitals to donate blood for the wounded.\n\nHazara demonstrators have continued to occupy Demazang Square, where the attack took place as the march was winding down and some prepared to set up a camp, Naji said. They would stay until three conditions were met, he said.\n\nThe Enlighten Movement wished to have its own representatives, as well as others from international human rights organizations, involved in a commission Ghani has established to investigate the IS attack.\n\nThe movement also wanted the power line rerouted through Bamiyan, as originally demanded. The multi-million-dollar regional project was routed away from Bamiyan by the previous Afghan government for financial considerations, according to people involved in the planning, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.\n\nThirdly, Naji said, they wanted the name of Demazang Square changed to Shahada or Martyrs\u2019 Square, \u201cto honor the memories of those who were killed, along with a picture of everyone who died there.\u201d\n\nGhani\u2019s spokesman Chakhansuri confirmed that the president has issued a decree to change the name of the square as the Hazaras had asked. He also said that Enlighten Movement members would participate in the investigation commission.\n\nIn response to the rerouting demand for the so-called TUTAP power project, Chakhansuri referred to a contract signed on June 21 for the transmission of a 300-megawatt power line from the north into Bamiyan. Like the TUTAP line, it is also funded by the Asian Development Bank.\n\nThe death toll in Saturday\u2019s attack was not yet finalized Sunday, according to the Interior Ministry. The ministry said on Saturday that 80 people were killed; Naji said the Enlighten Movement puts the death toll so far at 84.","70":"Afghanistan is observing a national day of mourning after a twin suicide bombing at a protest march in Kabul killed 80 people and wounded another 230.\n\nFamilies collected bodies from hospitals and morgues on Sunday in preperation for funerals in the west of the capital.\n\nSome families plan to buy their dead in Kabul, while others have chosen to hold funerals in their respective hometowns.

Nearly 100 people were killed in attacks on Shi\u2019ite protesters and worshipers in Kabul in July and October.\n\nHekmatullah Azamy, a researcher at the Kabul-based Centre for Conflict & Peace Studies, says the Kabul attacks are in line with IS\u2019s grand strategy.\n\n\u201cThey want to foment a larger [global] struggle between Shi\u2019a and Sunni Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir focus on targeting the Shi\u2019a in Kabul showcases this approach.\u201d\n\nAzamy noted that while the main IS presence in Afghanistan is limited to remote mountainous regions in eastern Nangarhar Province, the group is focused on attacking Shi\u2019ite communities in Kabul some 200 kilometers away.\n\n\u201cDaesh seems to be the future of militancy in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the broader region,\u201d he said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.\n\nA local chapter of IS, which branded itself Wilayat Khorasan, first emerged in Nangarhar in late 2014. By summer 2015, it controlled large swathes of the province, particularly six districts along its eastern border with Pakistan.\n\nIts reliance on extreme violence against civilians, government forces, and even the Taliban has provoked a tribal uprising, ground operations by the Afghan Army, and NATO air strikes. In some cases, however, the Taliban have ousted IS fighters from Nangarhar pockets.\n\nAfghan lawmakers still see the group as resilient and recently urged Kabul to rid Nangarhar of its presence.\n\n\u201cPeople need to pay close attention to this group because, unlike other militant groups in this region, it is not influenced by any state here,\u201d Azamy said. \u201cIS has now positioned itself as the second-most influential group in Afghanistan following the Taliban.\u201d\n\nLawmaker Ramzan Bashardost, a member of the Shi\u2019ite Hazara minority community, remains skeptical of IS\u2019s ability to succeed in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThis is pure barbarity. As long as there are B-52 bombers here, it is impossible to foment a sectarian war,\u201d he said, referring to the long-range U.S. bombers that many Afghans credited as playing a vital role in ousting the hard-line Taliban regime 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cSo long as the Hazara leaders enjoy a major share in power, they will be reluctant to join any sectarian strife despite such attacks,\u201d Bashardost said.\n\nSectarian violence between the majority Sunni, who make up nearly 85 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s 30 million population, and the minority Shi\u2019a has never featured as a key driver of the country\u2019s various cycles of war since the late 1970s.\n\nSince the overthrow of the Taliban regime, the once-marginalized Hazaras, who constitute a bulk of Afghanistan\u2019s Shi\u2019ite community, have enjoyed senior leadership positions in both the civilian and military parts of the Afghan government. Meanwhile, the lot of impoverished Hazara communities has also improved.\n\nAfghan government leaders are also adamant that IS\u2019s sectarian bid must fail.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani characterized the November 21 attack as \u201can attempt to sow seeds of discord\u201d but warned that \"terrorists cannot achieve their masters' goals by spreading fear,\" he said in a statement.\n\nChief Executive Abdullah Abdullah called the bombing an act against Islam and humanity.\n\n\u201cWhile we mourn the loss of our loved ones, we must make sure to work for unity and avoid the enemy plots that divide us by titles,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.","98":"A SUICIDE bomber has struck at a Shiite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing 32 people, the UN office said.\n\nThe bomber walked into the Shiite mosque in western Kabul where he detonated his explosives among the crowd of worshippers, Afghan police said.\n\nIt is the second large-scale attack targeting minority Shiites in Kabul in just over a month.\n\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, though Sunni extremists such as the Taliban and Islamic State militants, who view Shiites as heretics and apostates, frequently target Shiite mosques and public gatherings.\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said the explosion also wounded more than 50 people, many of them children.\n\nEarlier in the day Afghan authorities said at least 28 people were killed and 48 wounded.\n\n\"This appalling attack on worshippers is an atrocity,\" a statement from Pernille Kardel, the secretary-general's deputy special representative for Afghanistan, said.\n\n\"UNAMA expresses its revulsion at this latest effort by extremists to stoke sectarian violence in Afghanistan.\"\n\nMonday's bombing hit during a prayers ceremony commemorating 40 days since the anniversary of the death of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.\n\nThe ceremony is known as Arbaeen, meaning 40 in Arabic.

We had internal fighting in the past but never religious fighting,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament and a member of the mainly Shi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ite Hazara community that has been particularly targeted.The government has provided some basic training and weapons for a few hundred volunteer guards near mosques and other meeting places but many fear that the protection, which covers only some of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 400 Shi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ite mosques, is insufficient.In 2011, more than 80 people were killed in Ashura attacks in Kabul and the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and there have been a string of others since, with 20 people killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Kabul a month ago.Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack, by suicide bombers posing as shepherds walking their sheep along a road outside the Hussainya mosque in the Qala-e-Fatehullah area of the city, did not reach the mosque itself but wounded 20 people in addition to the five killed.No up-to-date census data exists for Afghanistan but different estimates put the size of the Shi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ite community at between 10-20 percent of the population, mostly Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras.Ashura, on the 10th day of the month of Muharram, celebrates the martyrdom of Hussein, one of the grandsons of the Prophet Mohammad, and is marked by large public commemorations by Shi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ite Muslims.President Ashraf Ghani condemned Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack and said it would not break the unity between religions in Afghanistan.But at a time when rivalry between the patchwork of different ethnic groups in the country has increasingly come into the open, Rahmani said the evident objective of the attacks was to ratchet up the tensions to create instability.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the past, there were warnings that there were groups that wanted to stir ethnic and religious conflict among Afghans but now it is reality,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Rahmani said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are people who want to create disunity among ethnic and religious groups,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said.Reporting by Mirwais Harooni and James Mackenzie;

Sharifi, the director of the journalist group, said at least seven of journalists lost their lives. \n\n\nImages from the scene showed men lying on the ground, their cameras flung amid pools of blood. Following the attack, colleagues of the slain and wounded reporters posted images of their friends on social media. \"I was at the hospital where the dead bodies of at least four journalists were kept \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a large group of journalists [gathered] there to mourn,\" said Sharifi. \"Everybody was heart broken, everybody was crying, everybody was sharing tears.\" Another Afghan journalist, Anees Ur Rehman, said he was speechless. \"Sorry, I don't have any words to express my feelings,\" he said. Journalists in Afghanistan, he said, were \"family.\" Ur Rehman said other reporters on the scene described the second bomber as being disguised as a journalist. \"They adopt behaviour of journalist,\" he said. He said his friends \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fellow reporters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c told him the explosives were concealed inside a video camera. \"This is a very big threat,\" he said. They are adopting \"new things\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c new methods \u00e2\u20ac\u201d of killing people, he said. Sharifi said he had heard a similar claim, but could not confirm it. Afghanistan is one of the world's deadliest countries for journalists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it also enjoys a vibrant, critical press. Sharifi described Afghanistan's press freedom as \"one of the biggest achievements of the government.\" \"It will definitely [meant to] push them away from covering such incidents, and [to] compel journalists to stop practicing journalism,\" he said. \"I really admire the courage,\" he said. \"Despite all odds they have continued following this difficult journey.\" Earlier this month, a suicide bombing at a voter registration center in Kabul killed more than 50 people.\n","161":"\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d A coordinated double suicide bombing by the Islamic State group hit central Kabul on Monday morning, killing at least 25 people, including nine Afghan journalists, officials said.\nAn AFP photographer, a cameraman for the local Tolo TV station and several reporters for the Afghan branch of Radio Free Europe were among the fatalities, police said.\nAt least 45 people were wounded in the twin attacks, according to Kabul police spokesman, Hashmat Stanekzai, who also said four policemen were among those killed.\nThe attack was the latest in a relentless string of deadly large-scale bombings and assaults that have struck Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan so far this year. And even as the Afghan capital reeled from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assault, a suicide car bombing a few hours later in the southern province of Kandahar killed 11 children, a police spokesman said. Eight Romanian NATO soldiers were wounded in that bombing.\nIn a statement posted on an IS-affiliated website, the Islamic State group said two of its martyrdom seekers carried out the Kabul bombings, targeting the headquarters of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renegade\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Afghan intelligence services.\nThe blasts took place in the central Shash Darak area, home to NATO headquarters and a number of embassies and foreign offices \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as well as the Afghan intelligence service.\nStanekzai, the police spokesman, said the first suicide bomber was on a motor bike while the second explosion meant to hit those scrambling to get to the scene to help the victims of the first blast.\nThe second attacker was on foot, in a crowd of reporters rushing to the site of the first attack, pretending to be one of the media, the spokesman said. The bomber then detonated his explosives while still among the reporters, Stanekzai said, intentionally targeting journalists.\nAgence France-Presse said the news agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, was among those killed. AFP said Marai died in a blast that struck journalists who had rushed to the scene of the earlier attack.\nMedia watchdog Reporters Without Borders said along with the nine journalists killed, six were wounded. However, Sediqullah Tawhidi, an official with the Afghan Journalist Safety Committee, sad only five journalists wounded. Conflicting casualty tolls are common in the immediate aftermath of big attacks.\nThe Paris-based group named the journalists, working for media organizations from multiple countries, adding that Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack was the deadliest targeting reporters since the fall of the Taliban in 2001.

The presidential palace released a statement saying that attacks targeting innocent civilians, worshippers inside the mosques, national and democratic processes, reporters and freedom of speech all are war crimes.\nThe U.S. Embassy also condemned the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153savage bombings\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in Kabul and reiterated its support for the Afghan people and Ghani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government in their fight against terrorism.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We extend our deepest condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues of all the victims, including a number of brave journalists among the dead and injured,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d it said, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153where media are in danger, all other human rights are under greater threat.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nKabul chief of police Dawood Amin said the area hit was quickly sealed off and authorities were investigating. Mohammad Mousa Zahir, director of Wazir Akbarkhan Hospital, said several people suffering injuries from the blasts were being treated at his hospital.\nIn its claim of responsibility, the Afghan affiliate of IS, known as Khorasan Province, said the first martyrdom seeker detonated his explosive vest near the intelligence service in central Kabul, forcing officers to head to the area of the explosion. The statement said the second attacker detonated his explosives vest after that. The statement, which exaggerated the overall death toll as militant claims often do, did not say journalists were specifically targeted.\nIn the Kandahar attack, an Afghan official said a suicide bomber targeted a NATO convoy in the district of Daman but killed 11 children from a religious school nearby. The children had gathered around the NATO convoy for fun when the bomber struck, said Abdul Rahim Ayubi, a lawmaker from Kandahar.\nMatiullah Helal, deputy spokesman for the provincial police chief, said 16 people were also wounded in that attack, including NATO soldiers, civilians and policemen.\nRomania\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 defense minister, Mihai Fifor, said eight Romanian troops with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carpathian Eagles\u00e2\u20ac\u009d were among the wounded.

John Nicholson, commander of NATO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Resolute Support mission, said in a statement that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if the enemies of Afghanistan think their cowardly actions will deter the commitment of the brave Afghan forces and our Resolute Support advisers, or the call by the Afghan people for peace, they are sorely mistaken.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nIn other violence Monday, at least four Afghan policemen were killed in northern Balkh province, said Sher Mohammad Abu-Tariq, the district chief in Nahri Shahi. The insurgents ambushed the police vehicle and fired RPGs.\nAlso, an Afghan police officer was killed and four people were wounded in an explosion in eastern Nangarhar province, said Attuhullah Khogynai, spokesman for the provincial governor. He said the slain officer was the chief of the criminal investigations unit for Behsud district.\nNo one claimed responsibility for the other attacks. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan first emerged in Nangarhar a few years ago, then expanded its footprint to elsewhere across the country.\nIS and the more firmly established Taliban carry out regular attacks, with the Taliban usually targeting the Afghan government and security forces and IS targeting members of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Shiite minority, whom the affiliate perceives as apostates.\nThe relentless assaults underscore the struggles that Afghan security forces have faced to reign in the militant groups since the United States and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. Both groups want to establish strict Islamic rule in Afghanistan.\nLast week, an Islamic State suicide bomber attacked a voter registration center in Kabul, killing 60 people and wounding at least 130 others. There were 22 women and eight children among the fatalities.\nAnd the month before, an IS suicide bomber targeted a Shiite shrine in Kabul where people had gathered celebrating the Persian new year.

The blast comes less than a day after a Taliban attack in northern Afghanistan killed more than 30 police officers and soldiers, and less than a week after the Taliban launched a surprise attack on the city of Ghazni.  The explosion on Wednesday, \"targeting an educational center in the west of the Afghan capital, tore through a large tent set up as a classroom in the courtyard,\" Reuters reports.  Initially, Reuters said that the blast killed at least 48 and wounded at least 67, but later reports said 34 students were killed and 56 hurt.

The attack targeted the Shiite neighborhood of Dasht-i-Barcha, the AP says:  \"The bombing, blamed on the Islamic State group, was the latest assault on Afghanistan's Shiite community, which has increasingly been targeted by Sunni extremists who consider Shiites to be heretics. \"It also showed how militants are still able to stage large-scale attacks, even in the heart of Kabul, and underscored the struggles of the Afghan forces to provide security and stability on their own.\"  The attack comes after a bloody week in Afghanistan.  Early on Wednesday, the Taliban attacked a checkpoint in Baghlan, in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 30 police officers and soldiers, the AP says.  Reuters reports the death toll could be as high as 44:  \"The defence ministry confirmed the incident early on Wednesday, but gave no details. Officials in the area said nine police and 35 soldiers were killed in the latest attack of a series that has killed dozens of security forces nationwide. \"A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the group targeted a military base and two checkposts in Baghlan, killing 70 Afghan security forces, and seizing armoured vehicles and ammunition.  \n\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Taliban attacked a police checkpoint in southern Zabul province, killing several police officers, a police chief told the AP.

The ceremony commemorated the 1995 slaying of Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Afghanistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ethnic Hazaras, who are mostly Shia Muslims.The Taliban said they were not involved in the attack, which came less than a week after the US and the group signed an ambitious peace deal that lays out a path for the withdrawal of American forces from the country.The interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said 32 people were killed and 81 wounded in the attack in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood of Kabul. The health ministry gave the same death toll but said 58 were wounded. All of the casualties were civilians, Rahimi said.The opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah, who is the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive and was a candidate in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election, was among several prominent political officials who attended the ceremony but left before the attack.Several TV journalists were covering the ceremony inside a walled compound when the gunmen began shooting, and a reporter and a cameraman for a local broadcaster were among the wounded.Karim Khalili, the chief of Afghanistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high peace council, was delivering a speech when the gunfire interrupted him.

I ran out of there to save my life.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dAfter opening fire, the two gunmen fled to a half-finished apartment building, leading to a five-hour standoff with security forces. They were eventually killed and security forces cleared the building, Rahimi said. The area was cordoned off by dozens of security forces.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Kabul last year, when a suicide bomber killed 63 people and wounded 182 at a wedding. All were from the Shia Hazara community.Any US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan would be tied to promises by the Taliban to fight terrorism and Isis. During the withdrawal, the US would retain the right to continue counter-terrorism operations in the country.The Taliban have been fighting Islamic State militants in its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan. US military officials have said Isis has been degraded because of US and Afghan operations but also by Taliban assaults. A US defence department official told the AP that there was concern that Isis was expanding its footprint into Kunar province, where the Taliban knows the terrain and could be an asset in tracking down Isis.","216":"The attackers shot at the ceremony from an under construction building.\n\nParticipants said that the attack was controversial and questionable.\n\nThe 25th death anniversary of Abdul Ali Mazari was held on Friday in PD^6, Kabul.\n\nThe attack charged when Karim Khalili, chair of the High Peace Council, started his speech.\n\nSome political figures including Abdullah Abdullah, Hamid Karzai, and Mohammad Mohaqeq participated in the ceremony.\n\nKarim Khalili said, \u201cThe government officials should clarify whether the people have the right to celebrate their leader or martyr.\u201d\n\nPictures exclusive to Ariana News show that the insurgents were positioned at an under-construction building near the ceremony.\n\nFew minutes after the attack, a special group of the US forces came to the scene to investigate the incident, and the Afghan Special Forces also started eliminating the insurgents.\n\nThe memorial ceremony of Mazari has been severally targeted by missile and suicide attacks.\n\nThe Taliban denied involvement  in the attack.

Several prominent politicians, including the country's chief executive and recent presidential candidate, Abdullah Abdullah, were in the audience but escaped unharmed. A spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of the Interior said the gunmen retreated to a nearby building, where they were killed during an hours-long standoff with security forces. An Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. The ceremony marked 25 years since the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, a leader of the country's Shiite minority, and the Sunni militant group that targeted a similar event last year. \"This situation looks endless in our country,\" one of the people injured in the attack told local media. \"There are political games, but only the poor people pay the price \u00e2\u20ac\u201d how long will this continue?\" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he called Abdullah, his erstwhile rival for the presidency, and Karim Khalili, the chief of Afghanistan's high peace council.

The deal outlined a 14-month timeline for the withdrawal of the thousands of Americans still stationed in Afghanistan, which would bring an end to the longest war in U.S. history. The U.S. troop drawdown is partly conditioned on the Taliban fulfilling their promises to combat and prevent the spread of terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaida. \n\n \nWorld \nU.S. Signs Peace Deal With Taliban After Nearly 2 Decades Of War In Afghanistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWorld \nU.S. Launches 'Defensive Strike' At Taliban As Fragile Afghan Peace Deal Teeters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut trouble quickly followed, as Ghani pushed back against the deal's proposal for a prisoner exchange, and the Taliban \u00e2\u20ac\u201d after a seven-day reprieve \u00e2\u20ac\u201d redoubled their deadly attacks on Afghan troops throughout the country.

The country's interior ministry confirmed that more than 57 others were wounded Saturday after the explosion went off in a heavily Shiite neighborhood, The Associated Press reported.  Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said the attacker attempted to enter the center but was stopped by security guards, according to the AP. The attacker then set off the explosives in a nearby alley, the Agence France-Presse reported.  Reuters, citing Arian, identified the target of the attack as the Kawsar-e Danish education center. The center offers training and courses for higher education students, the AFP says.    The western Kabul neighborhood where the bombing occurred has a large Shiite community, a minority group in the country that has been targeted by the Islamic State in the past.  The Islamic State took responsibility for the attack, though it did not provide any evidence, Reuters reported. The Taliban has denied responsibility for the bombing. \n\n\nThe attack came amid intensifying fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban, even as the two sides engage in peace talks. Those talks were spurred by a peace deal agreed to by the U.S. and the Taliban in February that would pave for the way for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country. Amnesty International said Friday that at least 50 civilians were killed in the past week in spite of the ongoing peace talks.  The Associated Press reported that a separate attack in eastern Afghanistan on Saturday killed nine people after a roadside bomb struck a minivan full of civilians. A second roadside bomb killed two policemen who were en route to respond.\n","234":"\nAfghan officials say at least 18 people have been killed in a suicide bombing that struck outside an educational center in Kabul's Dasht-e Barchi district.\nInterior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said at least 57 people were wounded in the attack on October 24 that was claimed by the Islamic State extremist group. The casualty figures could still rise, he added.\nThe bomber had tried to enter the Kawsar center but blew himself up as he was approached by security guards, Arian said in a statement.\nThe center offers training and courses for students in higher education in the mainly Shi'ite Hazara-dominated area in a western district of Kabul. \nThe AFP news agency quoted eyewitness Ali Reza as saying that most of the victims were students.\n\"I was standing about 100 meters from the center when a big blast knocked me down,\" he said. \"Dust and smoke were all around me.

By attacking schools, these spoilers want to take away girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right to education.\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from this tragic incident and other past attacks, it is that Afghan girls continue to demonstrate their resiliency by going to schools and universities, even if it means risking their lives.\nWhat, if any, implications are there for the peace process?\nBelquis: Rising violence will further undermine and complicate the peace process. Local communities, particularly religious and ethnic groups, will likely take matters into their own hands. The Hazara community in particular has been targeted repeatedly by ISIS and feels that government security forces have not done enough to protect them. There is an emergent incentive among some Afghan groups to establish self-defense militias, which could lead to greater political fragmentation and has disturbing echoes of the ethnic factionalism that drove the 1990s civil war. Former warlords, local militia commanders and new groups have begun arming their supporters in preparation for a much-deteriorated security situation.\nMore violence will reduce the chances for peace or reconciliation. Generally speaking, the Taliban benefit from ethnic divisions within the Afghanistan republic. The more united a party is in a peace process, the more power they have at the table. Both the Afghan government and Taliban are seeking to divide their opponents. But the Taliban are a more homogeneous group, which makes their task easier.\nOn the other hand, the issue of education does unite different factions within the Afghan republic.\u00c2\u00a0 Different regions of the country have different attitudes toward girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 education, but there is a strong national consensus outside of Taliban circles that all girls should have access to education. The bombing is seen by most Afghans as an atrocity and as an unacceptable attack on girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right to education.\nIf the Taliban continue to ignore calls for a cease-fire, they are undermining their own cause. Indeed, the Taliban hated their pariah status prior to the U.S.-Taliban agreement and now enjoy being seen as respectable interlocutors. The international community could decide to oppose further prisoner releases, stop engaging the Taliban at senior diplomatic levels and keep U.N. sanctions in place if they continue to enable attacks and deny women and girls their basic rights, including the right to equal education.\nCan you explain what the situation is like on the ground and how this attack has reverberated throughout the Hazara community?\nFatema: These kinds of attacks reinforce the idea among the minority Hazara ethnic group that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facing an ethnic cleansing campaign, or that there is a lack of concern from the Afghan state over their wellbeing. For example, the principal of the Sayed Al-Shuhada school requested months ago that the Ministry of Education help provide armed guards amid threats and other educational centers in the area being attacked. Hazara activists are sharing on social media related stories, scenarios, political speeches and past experiences to show that there is a link between the school attacks in West Kabul and systematic discrimination against the Hazara community more broadly throughout the country.\nThe attack has also led to increased fears of vulnerability among Hazaras as international forces withdraw. Hazaras \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a Shia, Dari-speaking minority ethnic group in Afghanistan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have long been persecuted by the Taliban. Like other minority groups, Hazaras saw international troops as a buffer against militant attacks. But many now feel abandoned.\nHow can the United States and international community help limit such attacks and preserve the gains women have made over the last two decades in the absence of a large military footprint?\nBelquis: The Afghanistan of today is very different than the Afghanistan of 20 years ago. The Taliban can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just expect to take over and impose their anachronistic worldview on Afghans like they did in the 1990s. But honoring the sacrifices and hard work of Afghan men and women to assert their constitutional, social, political and economic rights equates with protecting the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its constitutional order that enabled the hard-won gains.\nA top priority will, therefore, be to support the Afghan government, and the Afghan National Security Forces (ANDSF) in particular, to prevent major and rapid Taliban military gains that could create a domino effect leading to the collapse of the government. This requires the United States to keep NATO allies engaged and to maintain robust levels of military assistance for support to ANDSF against major Taliban offensives.\nThe attack on the school in West Kabul shows how the Taliban\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insurgency creates a vector for terrorist atrocities by a variety of groups. Because the Taliban keep the ANDSF on their heels and create ungoverned spaces, it provides its own militants and other terrorist groups with ample opportunity to attack Afghan forces and civilian targets. The 2018 Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocity Prevention Act calls for U.S. government efforts to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhance the capacity of the United States to prevent and respond to atrocities worldwide.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d In this vein, even as the U.S. troop presence dwindles, the United States should use whatever leverage it can to prevent mass killings like the May 8 bombing from happening again.\nThere is a larger lesson for the United States and Afghanistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbors as well: If the war is not controlled, and a political solution is not reached, the next target can be Islamabad or Washington or London, not an Afghan girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 school in Kabul.\nNone of Afghanistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbors or regional actors want to see the restoration of an Islamic emirate, or a descent into civil war. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Troika Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (the United States, Russia, China and Pakistan) issued a strong statement in this regard, and the Iranians have also repeatedly made this clear in official statements.\nThe U.S.-led Afghan peace process has done a great deal to legitimize the Taliban, which the Taliban are adept at leveraging, and which they value tremendously. International messaging should continue to focus on the fact that if the Taliban have dominance in potential power-sharing arrangements, and try to oppress Afghan citizens, especially women and minorities, they will quickly regain pariah status.\nFinally, the deteriorating security situation combined with the devastating impact of the drought will require significantly more resources and preparation for humanitarian response programming in both government- \u00c2\u00a0and Taliban-controlled areas. This means committing new money and not simply releasing the $300 million that the United States had already committed but then withheld, as well as having the World Bank convene a donor conference to discuss funding priorities that major donors should support, and the best mechanisms to provide support.\nFatema Ahmadi is a program officer at the U.S. Institute of Peace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kabul office.\n\n","246":"SummaryMost victims were schoolgirls, officials sayArea home to many Shi'ites from Hazara minority groupAt least 165 injured, doctors strugglingFamilies still searching for childrenTaliban deny involvementKABUL, May 9 (Reuters) - The death toll from a bomb attack outside a school in the Afghan capital Kabul has risen to 68, officials said on Sunday, with doctors struggling to care for 165 injured victims and families searching desperately for missing children.Explosions on Saturday evening shook the neighbourhood of Dasht-e-Barchi, home to a large community of Shi'ites from the Hazara ethnic minority which has been targeted in the past by Islamic State, a Sunni militant group.A car bomb was detonated in front of the Sayed Al-Shuhada school and two more bombs exploded when students rushed out in panic.Officials said most of those killed were schoolgirls. Some families were still searching hospitals for their children.\"The first blast was powerful and happened so close to the children that some of them could not be found,\" said an Afghan official, requesting anonymity.An eyewitness told Reuters all but seven or eight of the victims were schoolgirls going home after finishing their studies. On Sunday, civilians and policemen collected books and school bags strewn across a blood-stained road now busy with shoppers ahead of celebrations for Eid al-Fitr next week.President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday blamed Taliban insurgents but a spokesman for the group denied involvement and condemned any attacks on Afghan civilians.Pope Francis called the attack as \"inhuman act\" in remarks to pilgrims in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City on Sunday.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the attack and expressed his deepest sympathies to the victims' families and to the Afghan government and people.Families of the victims blamed the government and Western powers for failing to put an end to violence and the ongoing war.MORGUES[1\/10]\u00c2\u00a0People stand at the site of a blast in Kabul, Afghanistan May 8, 2021.

Some families were still searching for missing relatives on Sunday, gathering outside hospitals to read names posted on the walls, and checking morgues.\"The entire night we carried bodies of young girls and boys to a graveyard and prayed for everyone wounded in the attack,\" said Mohammed Reza Ali, who has been helping families of the victims at a private hospital.\"Why not just kill all of us to put and end to this war?\" he said.Security was intensified across Kabul after the attack but authorities said they would not be able to provide security to all schools, mosques and other public places.Conflict is raging in Afghanistan, with security forces in daily combat with the Taliban, who have waged war to overthrow the foreign-backed government since they were ousted from power in Kabul in 2001.Although the United States did not meet a May 1 withdrawal deadline agreed in talks with the Taliban last year, its military pull-out has begun, with President Joe Biden announcing that all troops will be gone by Sept. 11.But the foreign troop withdrawal has led to a surge in fighting between Afghan security forces and Taliban insurgents.Critics of the decision say the Islamist militants will make a grab for power and civilians live in fear of being subjected once more to brutal and oppressive Taliban rule.On Twitter, China's ambassador to Afghanistan, Wang Yu, said the abrupt U.S. announcement of a complete withdrawal of forces had led to a succession of attacks throughout the country.\"China calls on foreign troops in Afghanistan to take into full account the security of people in the country and the region, pull out in a responsible manner and avoid inflicting more turmoil and suffering on the Afghan people,\" he said.Condemning the killing of civilians, India's foreign ministry said the death of more than 50 young girls made this an attack on the future of Afghanistan.\"The perpetrators clearly seek to destroy the painstaking and hard-won achievements that the Afghans have put in place over the last two decades,\" a statement said.Reporting by Kabul bureau, Editing by Raju GopalakrishnanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","247":"The terrorists who\u00c2\u00a0exploded\u00c2\u00a0a bomb\u00c2\u00a0near a girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 school in\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0mostly\u00c2\u00a0Shiite district of west Kabul\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0Dasht-e-Barchi on Saturday \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must be held accountable\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0their\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153heinous crime\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the\u00c2\u00a0UN\u00c2\u00a0Special Representatives for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia\u00c2\u00a0Gamba, and\u00c2\u00a0on Violence Against Children, Najat\u00c2\u00a0Maalla\u00c2\u00a0M\u00e2\u20ac\u2122jid,\u00c2\u00a0said in a\u00c2\u00a0joint\u00c2\u00a0statement.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\nTweet URL\n\n\nWe must ensure that schools remain protected environments &amp; that girls are given equal opportunities to pursue their education - Joint statement w @UN_EndViolence on importance to protect #girls &amp; education in conflict after deadly attack in #Afghanistan  https:\/\/t.co\/b7CHQXC5Wq pic.twitter.com\/miY4AOGL4q\n\n\nChildren and Armed Conflict\n\nchildreninwar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to news reports,\u00c2\u00a0scores of\u00c2\u00a0people\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0many of them\u00c2\u00a0students\u00c2\u00a0between\u00c2\u00a0the ages of\u00c2\u00a011 and 15\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0were killed and\u00c2\u00a0hundreds of others injured.\u00c2\u00a0\nSafeguard\u00c2\u00a0girls\u00c2\u00a0education\u00c2\u00a0\nThe\u00c2\u00a0UN officials\u00c2\u00a0also\u00c2\u00a0called\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Afghan\u00c2\u00a0authorities to urgently protect the right to education in armed conflict, especially\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0girls,\u00c2\u00a0which is too often overlooked and neglected.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In many contexts, access to education is particularly harsh for girls for economic and cultural reasons, but also for security reasons of which the recent attack in Afghanistan is only one latest tragic example\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, they said, pushing for the safety of\u00c2\u00a0schools\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153and that girls just like boys are given equal opportunities to pursue their education\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2\u00a0\nAfghanistan schools\u00c2\u00a0targeted\u00c2\u00a0\nAfghanistan\u00c2\u00a0schools and hospitals\u00c2\u00a0remain one of the most attacked, according to\u00c2\u00a0the\u00e2\u20ac\u00af2019 Secretary-General Report on Children and Armed Conflict.

Dasht-e-Barchi is dominated by the Shiite Hazara community, who for years has been the target of violence by the Daesh-Khorasan Province (Daesh-K).\n The Daesh-K late Friday claimed responsibility for what it said were three explosions targeting buses carrying Shiites. The bombings ended up \"destroying the buses and killing and wounding dozens of them,\" according to the group's message translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, a platform that monitors terrorist activity. Broken glass and mangled vehicles were seen near the spot, where one of the explosions occurred. In November, a similar bomb attack on a minibus in Dasht-e-Barchi killed two people and wounded five others in an attack that also was claimed by Daesh-K.\n Daesh-K terrorist group, which is an offshoot of the Daesh that established a so-called caliphate across swathes of Iraq and Syria from 2014 until 2017, also claimed responsibility for an Oct. 15 suicide bomb attack on a Shiite mosque in Kandahar that killed at least 60 people and injured scores more. That attack came a week after another deadly mosque blast claimed by the group in northern Kunduz province killed over 60 people. The Taliban has vowed to crush this rival Sunni terrorist group, launching crackdowns against hideouts used by the terrorists, especially in the country's south and east. Friday's bus bombings included the first fatal attack reported by the Taliban for several weeks. But Kabul has been hit by repeated blasts lately that the Taliban say have been non-fatal. The Taliban took control after a two-decade absence on Aug. 15, when the previous government's resistance melted amid the final stages of the United States military withdrawal from the country. The Taliban's first stint in power lasted from 1996 to 2001, before the U.S. invasion toppled it.\n","282":"\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27 Oct 2020 | 05:00 AM UTC\nAfghanistan: Emerging reports of explosion in Kabul's PD10 October 27\nEmerging reports of explosion in Shahrak-e Aria area of Kabul's PD10 on October 27; avoid the area\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nsecurity\n\n\n\ntransportation\n\n\n\nAFG\n\n\n\n\n\nEventEmerging reports indicate that an improvised explosive device (IED) has detonated in the Shahrak-e Aria area of Kabul's Police District 10 (PD10) on Tuesday afternoon, October 27.
