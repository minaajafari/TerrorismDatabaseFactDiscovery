","BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
","NATO says three of its service members have been killed by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan.

The coalition said the attack occurred Wednesday. It did not say which country the soldiers were from, or give a more precise location of the attack.

The deaths brings to 14 the number of international troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year. Last year was the deadliest of the nearly decade-long war for international forces, with more than 700 killed, compared to just over 500 in 2009.

The NATO deaths came on a day when the Taliban struck at Afghan intelligence services, killing four people in a suicide bombing in the country’s capital and another two in a roadside bombing in the eastern province of Kunar.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP’s earlier story is below.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - The Taliban took aim at Afghanistan’s intelligence services Wednesday, killing six people and wounding more than 30 in two separate attacks, including a suicide bombing on a bus in the capital, officials said.

The attacks follow a surprise visit to Kabul a day earlier by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who praised advances made against the insurgency while noting that the gains were “fragile and reversible.” Biden left Afghanistan for neighboring Pakistan Wednesday morning.

In Kabul, a suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up next to a minibus carrying intelligence service employees to work, killing four people, President Hamid Karzai’s office said. The Interior Ministry said the blast wounded 32 people, including six intelligence service members - although it spoke of only two people killed - one intelligence service member and a civilian. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.

About an hour later in the troubled eastern province of Kunar, a remote-controlled roadside bomb killed an intelligence service colonel and his driver, and wounded two bodyguards, said Abdul Saboor Allahyar, deputy chief of Kunar’s provincial police.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for both attacks.

Insurgents often target Afghan security officials, although over the past few months the nation’s capital has been largely spared the worst of the major attacks in the country.

The powerful blast in Kabul struck on a busy road during the morning rush-hour, shattering the windows of dozens of houses. The suicide bomber’s body lay in the street near the wreckage of his motorbike as police and intelligence officials cordoned off the area.

Karzai condemned the bombing, calling it “an act against humanity and against Islam.”

NATO also condemned the attack, saying it had killed at least one intelligence service member and one civilian, and wounded at least 32 people.

The Taliban has proven resilient in the face of the U.S.-led military coalition’s nearly decade-long war. Although NATO poured more than 30,000 extra troops into the country last year to pressure the insurgents’ traditional strongholds in the south, the Taliban have boosted their operations elsewhere, launching attacks across the north and east.

An extra contingent of 1,400 U.S. Marines are to be deployed in the coming months in the southern province of Helmand, which along with neighboring Kandahar have seen some of the fiercest fighting.

NATO says its campaign so far has had a significant impact. The alliance’s spokeswoman, Oana Lungescu, said that “thousands of insurgent leaders have been killed or captured and several thousand fighters have been taken off the battlefield” in the past year.

Lungescu described the guerrilla war as an “industrial strength” insurgency, but disputed recent estimates from military and diplomatic officials at NATO headquarters that placed Taliban forces at up to 25,000 fighters. She called such estimates “highly unreliable,” and said focusing on the numerical strength of the Taliban misrepresents gains made by the alliance in the past year.

“There has never been a single reliable source for the size of the insurgency. Numbers referred to a year ago were certainly based on best guess estimates at that time,” Lungescu said in e-mailed comments, adding that estimates at the end of 2009 “were anywhere from 25,000 to 35,000.”

Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi said Wednesday that no official Afghan government figures were available, but he estimated the size of the Taliban was between 25,000 and 35,000 people.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-nato-3-service-members-killed-in-afghanistan-2011jan12-story.html

","BY LAURA KING, LOS ANGELES TIMES
","Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan —  A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up Wednesday next to a minibus carrying members of Afghanistan’s main intelligence service, killing at least two other people and injuring more than 30. It was the second bombing in the capital in eight days, a slight but worrying uptick in attacks in Kabul.
At almost the same time, a remote-controlled bomb killed the deputy intelligence chief and his driver in the eastern province of Kunar.

The dual attacks on intelligence officials coincided with a deadly day for Western troops in Afghanistan. Six members of the NATO force were killed by improvised bombs, five in the country’s east, and one in the south. Their nationalities were not disclosed by the Western military, but Americans make up the bulk of troops in both those regions.

Adding to the turmoil, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s attorney general said an investigation had been launched on possible wrongdoing at Kabul Bank, the nation’s largest financial institution, which nearly collapsed last year and is now under the stewardship of the nation’s central bank. Kabul Bank’s major shareholders include a number of people close to President Hamid Karzai.

The Kabul explosion, which took place during morning rush hour on a crowded road in the western part of the city, came as Vice President Joe Biden was concluding a visit to Afghanistan. The vice president, who departed about 90 minutes after the blast, had traveled to an air base north of Kabul after meeting Karzai in the capital Tuesday.

The Taliban took responsibility for both bombings, and boasted that the one in Kabul had killed 14 people. It is not unusual for the movement to make exaggerated claims about an attack’s effectiveness.

The head of the criminal investigation department for the Kabul police, Gen. Mohammad Zahir, identified the dead as an officer with the National Directorate of Security, the nation’s premier intelligence service, and one civilian, in addition to the bomber. Six of the 32 injured were NDS personnel, he said, and the others were civilian bystanders.

The toll could rise, officials said, because at least two people suffered critical injuries.

The attack took place near the ruins of a former imperial palace, close to the city’s main psychiatric hospital. Zahir noted that motorists usually try to avoid even honking their horns in the vicinity of the mental asylum, so as not to frighten or disturb the patients.

“But the person who committed such a harrowing and brutal incident in front of the psychiatric hospital can’t be counted as human,” he said. Half a dozen people in the building, including patients and medical personnel, were hurt by flying glass, though none seriously.

Karzai condemned the bombing, as did the U.S. Embassy and NATO’s International Security Assistance Force.

Recently, Western military officials had pointed to a drop-off in attacks in Kabul, and linked that decrease at least in part to the success of targeted strikes against the Haqqani network, a Taliban offshoot based in Pakistan’s tribal area of North Waziristan. The Haqqanis were responsible for a number of spectacular attacks in the Afghan capital in 2008 and ’09.

Before last week’s bombing in Kabul, which killed a policeman, an attack in December on a military bus on the city’s outskirts killed five Afghan army personnel. That was the first major strike in Kabul since May, when a suicide bomber attacked a convoy carrying senior Western military officials, killing 18 people. The dead in that strike included six members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization force, several of them high-ranking officers.

It was not clear whether the Kabul attack was planned as a strike against the intelligence service or the minibus was a target of opportunity. The Afghan intelligence services are thought to have played a significant role in pinpoint strikes by Western and Afghan troops against midlevel Taliban commanders, which the NATO force says have damaged the movement’s command structure.",https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-jan-13-la-fg-afghanistan-bombing-20110113-story.html

","KABUL, Afghanistan – A suicide bomber on a motorbike struck a minibus in the western part of the Afghan capital Wednesday, killing at least two people and wounding four, Interior Ministry spokesman Zemeri Bashary said.

Witnesses said the bus was carrying intelligence service employees on their way to work, but Bashary would not confirm the target.

The powerful blast on a busy street during Kabul’s early morning rush hour shattered the windows of dozens of houses and buildings nearby, while the bus and two private vehicles were damaged. The suicide bomber’s body and his destroyed motorbike lay nearby.

The bombing broke a relative reprieve from major attacks inside the Afghan capital in the past few months.

Gunfire rattled through the area -- home to the British, Canadian, Pakistani and other missions -- at the start of the assault, which one witness told police was launched by a man in his forties, with dark skin and a long beard.

Bodies were carried from the blackened hull of the “Finest” supermarket, popular with foreigners and several hundred yards from the British embassy, as fires broke out among shattered shelves and scattered food. The wounded were led away wailing.

President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack as un-Islamic, and put the toll at nine, one higher than police, who said six people were wounded. They declined to give the victims’ nationalities.

The Taliban said they had carried out the attack. It was aimed at foreigners but the primary target was the head of security firm Xe Services, formerly known as Blackwater, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters by telephone.Police said there were no security employees among the dead.

“We claim responsibility for the attack. It was carried out at a time when foreigners were shopping, including the head of a security company,” Mujahid said.

Phone card salesman Mehrab Gol, one of a group who cluster on a roundabout outside the shop, said the attacker was well armed.

“The suicide bomber fired first and then threw a grenade and then he blew himself up. There were three explosions,” he said.

“Then there was chaos inside and people were running away...There were many wounded but there was nobody there to carry them away.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-explosion-idUSTRE70R1UJ20110128

Afghan security officials were still removing bodies from the upmarket Finest supermarket in the Afghanistan capital's diplomatic neighbourhood as distraught relatives waited for news.

Kabul's police chief, Mohammad Ayub Salangi, confirmed claims by witnesses that today's attack was carried out by a single suicide bomber.

In a text message sent to the Guardian and other media organisations the Taliban's spokesman claimed responsibilty for the blast, saying they were targeting the ""head of Blackwater company in Afghanistan"". There is no confirmation that any employee of the private US security contractor, now know as Xe Services, was in the shop at the time.

A supermarket worker, who had been packing customers' shopping, said he heard two grenades being thrown on the ground. He initially thought were falling glass bottles but when he saw they were grenades he sprinted out the front door seconds before the blasts, which were followed by the main explosion of the suicide bomb.

He did not say which firm was targeted and it was not immediately clear if security firm employees were among the dead.

A senior police source told the Reuters news agency that officers at the scene had concluded from preliminary evidence that it was a suicide attack.

It was the first major attack on civilians in Kabul since two suicide bombers detonated explosives near the city’s biggest shopping centre and a hotel last February, killing at least 14.However, there have been several attacks on both foreign and Afghan security forces since then.

Violence in Afghanistan is at its worst level since the overthrow of the Taliban by US-backed Afghan forces in late 2001 with record casualties on all sides of the conflict and a raging uprising that has shown little sign of abating.

The neighborhood is home to a number of Western embassies and other international organizations, and the attack was an ominous sign that insurgents remain able to penetrate the most tightly guarded districts of Kabul.

Witnesses said some foreigners appeared to be among the dead and injured, and the Reuters news agency said one of those killed was a child. The blast heightened anxiety among the international community, which has been rattled in recent months by President Hamid Karzai’s move to rein in private security firms, which provide protection to most foreign installations.

The explosion, the most serious attack in months in Kabul, was apparently caused by a suicide bomber, according to Gen. Mohammed Zahir, the head of criminal investigations with the Kabul police. The blast gutted the first floor of the grocery store, igniting small fires, shattering the storefront windows and tossing about canned goods and other food items. Smoke billowed into the air and bloodied victims staggered into the street.

The explosion shattered what had been a relative lull in attacks in the capital over the past year, although violence had been creeping up in recent weeks. Western military officials had attributed the slowdown in suicide bombings and other attacks in Kabul to an intense campaign by NATO forces targeting midlevel commanders belonging to the Taliban and to an offshoot, the Pakistan-based Haqqani network, which was blamed for a series of major attacks in the capital in the past three years.

Friday is the main prayer day of the Muslim week, when many shops and businesses close.

The Taliban claimed responsibilty for Monday’s attack, which also left several people wounded.

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Kabul, said “panic” and “chaos” followed the attack.

“It took security forces hours to evacuate people trapped inside the complex, because they were worried other attackers were inside the building,” she said.

Monday’s assault is the first bombing in Kabul since January 28 when a suicide attacker blew himself up at a supermarket, killing at least eight people.

Colonel Baloch Orikhil, director of criminal investigation for the Kabul police, told the Associated Press news agency that initial reports indicated that a suicide bomber detonated a cache of explosives inside the building known as the Safi Landmark.

“We have reports that there was a suicide attack – one person blew himself up – and other insurgents went into the building,” he said.

Following the blast, the hotel was surrounded by hundreds of Afghan security forces. The blast destroyed the guarded entrance to the building and blew out windows.

Government officials, businessmen and foreigners regularly hold meetings at the Safi Landmark.

The building was heavily damaged a year ago when suicide attackers struck two residential hotels nearby, killing at least 20 people.After that attack, shops at the centre, which sell jewellery, electronics and clothing, were closed for months.

Violence across Afghanistan in 2010 reached its worst levels since the Taliban was toppled by US-backed Afghan forces in 2001, although the city had enjoyed almost a year of relative calm. That now appears to have come to an end.

In other violent incidents, NATO said on Monday that a homemade bomb killed a soldier in Afghanistan’s south, while the UK defence ministry said two soldiers from the Royal Logistic Corps were killed in a fire at Camp Bastion, the main British military base.

The base is northwest of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province.

A total of 14 NATO soldiers have been killed in February alone.. ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/2/14/sucide-bomber-targets-kabul-hotel

NEWS WIRES-France24","REUTERS - A suicide attacker on Monday targeted a downtown Kabul hotel that was hit by a similar assault nearly a year ago, killing at least three people and wounding several others, Afghan and Western officials said.

 
The insurgent detonated his explosives at the entrance to the Safi Landmark hotel, leaving a pile of shattered glass and mangled metal. Gunshots were heard soon after the explosion.
 
""Three guards were killed, two civilians have been wounded and one is missing, after the suicide bomber blew himself up,"" said a police official who asked not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
 
Vendors from shops that occupy the first few floors of the hotel building took stock of wrecked storefronts and damaged inventory, as a police pickup sped away with at least one body.
 
""It was a huge blast, that deafened me,"" said gemstone seller Tamim Mehraj, whose shop is metres from the site of the blast.
 
""The windows have been blown out and the shop is damaged.""
 
A severed head, apparently from the bomber, still lay on the street outside.
 
A Western military official said initial concerns that a second suicide bomber was part of the assault plan had not been confirmed.
 
Violence in Afghanistan has reached the highest levels since the 2001 ouster of the Taliban, with civilian and military casualties at record levels.
 
Monday's assault came barely two weeks after a suicide bomber attacked a supermarket frequented by foreigners in the heart of the city's diplomatic district, killing at least nine people.
 
Several insurgent groups claimed responsibility for that attack.
 
In February 2010, at least 16 people were killed and dozens more wounded in a series of attacks on the Safi Landmark hotel and nearby guesthouses.

Taliban Attack On Landmark Kabul Hotel Kills 12, Injures 18

June 29, 2011


","BY RFE/RL


","Afghan President Hamid Karzai says a brazen overnight attack on a landmark Kabul hotel will not derail plans for the transfer of security responsibilities to Afghan forces.

Twenty-one people are now known to have died in the hours-long attack -- claimed by the Taliban -- on the Hotel Inter-Continental Kabul.

The dead include Afghan civilians, policemen, a Spanish airline pilot, and all nine attackers.

Karzai's office ""condemned in the strongest terms"" the attack as a ""ruthless act of terror."" In the same statement, the perpetrators are described as ""mercenary terrorists who enjoy bloodletting of the innocent human beings.""
VIDEO INTERVIEW: U.S. President Barack Obama on security handover

Karzai himself is quoted as saying that ""no such attacks can stand in our way to implement the transition process.""

The transfer of security from international forces is to begin in seven areas of Afghanistan in the coming weeks, following an announcement last week by U.S. President Barack Obama.An Afghan soldier aims his gun as he guards the area surrounding the Hotel Inter-Continental during the deadly attack by Taliban insurgents.

Armed with rocket-propelled grenades, rifles, and explosive suicide vests, the attackers stormed the heavily guarded hilltop hotel in western Kabul late at night.

Hotel employees and guests say the attackers played Taliban songs on tape recorders and shot anyone they saw as they stormed the multistory building.

Some guests reportedly jumped from the second and third floors to escape the onslaught.

Private security guard Mohamamd Ibrahim was waiting for his boss in a car outside the hotel when he heard gunshots.

He told RFE/RL's Radio Free Afghanistan that he saw a man carrying a heavy machine gun chasing one of the hotel guards into the main building. But just as the man was entering the building, he turned back and opened fire on people outside.

""I saw with my eyes that he turned back and fired on the people outside,"" Ibrahim said. ""I don't know if they were injured, whether they died or survived. I saw a traffic police officer and two civilian taxi drivers getting hit.""

Another local resident described the attack to Reuters as ""a huge blast...inside the hotel"" at around 10:30 p.m. local time. He then heard ""gunfire and blasts"" and described residents fearing the worst until the siege ended after daybreak.

The five-hour long attack ended with early morning NATO helicopter raids killing what were thought to be the last of the insurgents, on the hotel's rooftop.

Inside Job?

Afghan officials claim that all nine suicide bombers and gunmen were killed by early morning.

Thirteen civilians and five policemen were injured, according to an Interior Ministry statement.

Kabul police chief Ayoub Salangi told reporters that they were searching the hotel room by room.

Latifullah Mashal, the spokesman of the Afghan National Directorate for Security, acknowledged to reporters in Kabul that there had been a security lapse.

""There is no doubt that there was a [security] failure and the attackers were helped from inside,"" Mashal said. ""Our investigation will determine where the problem was exactly. Was there a lapse in the response of the security forces or something else? Also, in one part of the hotel renovation work was going on. It is possible that these attackers infiltrated into the hotel posing as laborers, masons, or painters.""

The Inter-Continental is popular with foreigners and a venue for conferences and weddings. It formerly was part of the InterContinental Hotels Group but has had no association with the group since 1979.

The attack is the latest targeting hotels and supermarkets frequented by foreigners. While Kabul has been peaceful compared to the rest of Afghanistan, high-profile attacks are meant to showcase the Taliban ability to strike at will.

The attack came on the eve of a conference in Kabul about transferring responsibility for security from international to

","AP - At least one suicide bomber blew himself up late Tuesday night inside a Western-style hotel in Kabul, police said. Afghan police were battling the assailants with machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades as tracer rounds went up over the blacked out building.

Associated Press reporters at the scene heard bursts of gunfire and saw shooting from the roof of the five-story Inter-Continental hotel, which is frequented by Afghan political leaders and foreign visitors.

Police ordered bystanders to lay on the ground for safety. There was no immediate word on casualties in the rare, nighttime attack in the Afghan capital.A guest who was inside also said he heard gunfire echoing throughout the building. The hotel sits on a hill overlooking the city and streets leading up to it were blocked. The scene was dark as electricity at the hotel was out.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack in a telephone call to the AP.

Azizullah, an Afghan police officer who uses only one name, told an Associated Press reporter at the scene that at least one bomber entered the hotel and detonated a vest of explosives.

Another police officer, who would not disclose his name, said there were at least two suicide bombers.

Jawid, a guest at the hotel, said he jumped out a one-story window to flee the shooting.
“I was running with my family,” he said. “There was shooting. The restaurant was full with guests.”

The Inter-Continental - known widely as the “Inter-Con”  - was once part of an international chain. But when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the hotel, was left to fend for itself.

The Inter-Continental, which opened in the late 1960s, was the nation’s first international luxury hotel. It has at least 200 rooms.

It was used by Western journalists during the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, has been targeted before.

On Nov. 23, 2003, a rocket exploded nearby, shattering windows but causing no casualties.

Twenty-two rockets hit the Inter-Con between 1992 and 1996, when factional fighting convulsed Kabul under the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani. All the windows were broken, water mains were damaged and the outside structure pockmarked. Some, but not all, of the damage was repaired during Taliban rule.

Attacks in the Afghan capital have been relatively rare, although violence has increased since the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden in a U.S. raid in Pakistan and the start of the Taliban’s annual spring offensive.

On June 18, insurgents wearing Afghan army uniforms stormed a police station near the presidential palace and opened fire on officers, killing nine.

Late last month, a suicide bomber wearing an Afghan police uniform infiltrated the main Afghan military hospital, killing six medical students. A month before that, a suicide attacker in an army uniform sneaked past security at the Afghan Defense Ministry, killing three people.

Other hotels in the capital have also been targeted.

In January 2008, militants stormed the capital’s most popular luxury hotel, the Serena, hunting down Westerners who cowered in a gym during a coordinated assault that killed eight people. An American, a Norwegian journalist and a Philippine woman were among the dead.

On Feb. 26, 2010, insurgents struck two residential hotels in the heart of Kabul, killing 20 people including seven Indians, a French filmmaker and an Italian diplomat.

Scores of people, including children, were injured, reports said.

The first explosion occurred at midday outside Abul Fazl shrine in the centre of Kabul, ripping through throngs of worshippers. 

The second bomb was strapped to a bicycle when it went off in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The blast killed four people.

The bicycle bomb went off almost at the same time as the one in Kabul, as a convoy of Afghan Shias drove down a road in another part of the country, shouting in celebration of the Shia Muslim holiday of Ashoura. The holiday marks the death of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.

Religiously motivated attacks on Shias are rare in Afghanistan, although they are common in neighbouring Pakistan. No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blasts, reminiscent of the wave of sectarian attacks that shook Iraq during the height of the war.Afghan President Hamid Karzai, speaking at a news conference after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, said Tuesday's attack was unprecedented in scope. He said it was ""the first time that on such an important religious day in Afghanistan terrorism of that horrible nature is taking place.""
Mohammad Bakir Shaikzada, the top Shia cleric in Kabul, said he could not remember a similar attack having taken place on such a scale.

""This is a crime against Muslims during the holy day of Ashoura,"" he said, declining to place blame. ""We Muslims will never forget these attacks. It is the enemy of the Muslims who are carrying them out.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/afghan-suicide-bombs-kills-at-least-60-shias-1.1055874

The victims were celebrating Ashura, the most important holiday in the Shia calendar. The attack – disowned by the Taliban – was the deadliest in Afghanistan since 2008. Some Afghan officials and analysts immediately blamed Pakistan for the attack, saying insurgent groups based there wanted to foment unrest between Afghans.

""They [Pakistan] carried out this attack because they want to change the face of the war in Afghanistan, from an insurgency to a civil war,"" said Wahiullah Rahmani, the founder and director of the Kabul Centre for Strategic Studies. ""They want Afghan people to fight each other. This is why they attacked the Shia people. The Pakistani people want to separate Afghan people and make them the enemies of each other.""Speaking in Bonn, where he had been attending an international conference on his country's future, President Hamid Karzai said it was ""the first time that, on such an important religious day in Afghanistan, terrorism of that horrible nature is taking place"". He cancelled a trip to the UK to head back to Kabul.

The blast in Kabul killed 55 people, including four children and two women, and injured 134 others, according to a statement released by the Kabul police. Outside the Emergency Hospital in Kabul's Shahr-e Naw commercial district, a mob of more than 300 people soon congregated, some offering to give blood, others desperately trying to find out whether their relatives were among the dead and injured that had been admitted. Many were in the black robes worn during the Ashura ceremony.

People fearfully examined a heap of bloody shoes and scarves matted with flesh that had been removed from victims and left outside the hospital's main gates. A child-sized green flip flop was on top of the heap.

An elderly woman clad in a black headscarf and long black cloak grabbed a pair of shoes she recognised and fell to the ground, wailing, as she clutched them to her chest.

The explosion, just before noon at the Abul Fazl shrine in the Murad Khane area of Kabul, was followed soon after by an explosion in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif that killed four people and injured 27 others.
Explosives were placed on a bicycle parked in Alikozai Square, about 400m from the Blue Mosque, and were detonated remotely, said the deputy provincial police chief, Abdul Rawuf Taj. It was intended to disrupt an Ashura procession. A second bomb was defused.

There was a third explosion in Kandahar, according to Zalmai Ayoubi, a spokesman for the provincial governor. There were no casualties in that attack.The Taliban condemned the attack, saying it was ""against Muslim laws and against humanity"". In a statement, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, blamed the attack on ""the foreigners or invaders"", adding: ""With those attacks, they want Afghan civilians to hate the Taliban more and more.""

Haji Mohammed Mohaqiq, a leading Shia figure, appealed for calm among Afghans saying this was a time for unity. But he also warned the ""enemies of peace and stability in Afghanistan"" that the killings would be avenged.

""This attack is unacceptable,"" Haji Mohaqiq said. ""We will respond to this enemy attack. We will not forget this attack. We will have our revenge on our enemies.""

Asked who he thought was responsible for the violence, he answered: ""It is obvious it is Pakistan; Pakistan is always trying to carry out violent attacks in Afghanistan."" The Hazaras, who are Shia Muslims, were treated harshly under the Taliban regime and were not allowed to observe religious holidays such as yesterday's.

Since the hardline Sunni regime was ousted in 2001, sectarian attacks in Afghanistan have been rare. Such attacks, however, are common in Iraq and Pakistan.

The suicide bomb at the shrine produced the highest death toll in a single incident in Afghanistan since the blast at the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, which killed 60 people.

The site at the Abl Fazl shrine was sealed off by Afghan National Security Forces. Meanwhile a skirmish broke out between Sunni and Shia students at Balkh University in Mazar-e-Sharif.

Ashura: The most important day of the year

The festival of Ashura is the most important day of the year for Shia Muslims who use it to commemorate the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, Hussein ibn Ali, in 680AD – one of the events that contributed to the split between Shia and Sunni denominations.

Although all Muslims celebrate the day with a voluntary fast, it is only Shia Muslims who spend it in prayer and re-enacting the events that led to Hussein's death.

About 15 percent of Afghans are Shia and until now there have been few incidents of sectarian violence in the country.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/new-fears-of-sectarian-strife-after-kabul-blast-6273182.html

Around 150 people were wounded when the bomb exploded amid a throng of worshippers, including women and children, who were hemmed in on a street between the Abul Fazl shrine and the Kabul river. A second bomb, which killed four people in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, also targeted pilgrims heading to a commemoration of the holy festival of Ashura.Last night it was reported that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has cancelled a visit to the UK to return to Afghanistan in the wake of the bombings.A policeman who witnessed the Kabul attack said the suicide bomber worked his way into the centre of a crowd that had gathered to watch young men engaged in ritual flagellation to mourn the death in the seventh century of Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.

""I saw bodies and limbs fly up into the air,"" said Rohullah, another witness 21 year old who was standing on a rooftop overlooking the procession of worshippers.

Terrified survivors streamed away from the blast, leaving behind a horrific scene of carnage. Dozens of bodies lay scattered around a dark patch on the road where the bomb had exploded.

A Pakistani militant group with close ties to al-Qaida said it had carried out the attack, although security sources could not confirm the group's involvement. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Alami claimed responsibility in a phone call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station set up by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

The Taliban were quick to condemn the bombing, the bloodiest single incident for Afghan civilians since 2008. Shia Muslims, who make up around 20% of the population, and other minorities suffered when the hardline Sunni movement was in power, but in recent times the Taliban have tried to portray themselves as a force for national unity.

In an emailed statement, the movement described the attacks as ""un-Islamic"" and blamed the ""invading enemy"", one of the terms they use to describe US-led Nato forces. They alleged foreigners were trying to foment unrest in order to extend the length of their stay in the country.

The Taliban have stretched credulity in the past by denying responsibility for attacks that have killed large numbers of civilians and outraged public opinion. But Martine van Bijlert, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, said this time the denial seemed plausible.

""It doesn't fit with what they have done in the past, unless it turns out that they, or a group or them, have quite fundamentally changed,"" she said.

Although there is a long history of bomb attacks on Shias in neighbouring Pakistan, there has never been such a large-scale attack in Afghanistan, raising fears that radical outside groups are being drawn into the already complex and fragmented Afghan insurgency.

Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Almi is a splinter group of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), which maintained training camps in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime but has not mounted attacks in the country in recent years. General Mohammad Zahir, the chief of Kabul CID, said he believed LeJ was involved in Tuesday's attack, although a LeJ operative in Pakistan told the Guardian his group was not involved.

The group has admitted atrocities in the past, including the killing of 29 Shia pilgrims on a bus in Pakistan's Baluchistan province in September. It is also believed to have been behind an attack on an Ashura procession in Karachi that killed 30 people in 2009.

LeJ, whose operational leadership hides in Pakistan's tribal areas, is considered to be the Pakistani militant group closest to al-Qaida. It is also closely tied to the Pakistani Taliban.

""What is clear is that this is a new development in Afghanistan,"" said Van Bijlert. ""It is not part of the fault lines of the conflict that we are aware of. It looks designed to provoke sectarian or ethnic tensions.""

Immediately after the blast, armed police rushed to the scene, throwing a security cordon round the historic neighbourhood of Murad Khani, which is close to several government ministries.

Stunned and tearful locals milled around as loudspeakers still played recorded verses of the Qur'an. Furious young men stalked the area of the bombing, shouting at police and foreign journalists.

People worried about their missing relatives ran down traffic-free streets to get to the scene, while others crowded around a nearby hospital run by the Italian organisation Emergency.

Many of the worshippers at the shrine in Kabul were Hazaras, a mostly Shia ethnic minority which was persecuted by the Taliban regime.

Shortly after the attack in Kabul, a bomb carried on a bicycle exploded not far from the famous Blue Mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif. Zahir Wahdat, the deputy governor of Balkh province, said four people were killed and approximately five wounded. He said he believed the bomber had been trying to get inside the mosque.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/06/55-dead-kabul-suicide-shia

In the deadliest incident, a suicide bomb struck a shrine packed with worshippers in the capital, Kabul, killing at least 54 people.

Another blast struck near a Shia mosque the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif at about the same time, killing four.

The attacks appear to be of a sectarian nature unprecedented in recent Afghan history, correspondents say.

The US has condemned the attacks, saying it continues to ""stand with the Afghan people"".

The blasts coincided with the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura - the most important day in the Shia calendar and marked with a public holiday in Afghanistan.

Ashura is the climax of Muharram, the month of mourning for the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson.

Though tensions exist between Afghanistan's Sunni and minority Shia Muslims, most attacks in Afghanistan in recent years have targeted government officials or international forces, correspondents say.The near-simultaneous explosions happened at about midday (07:30 GMT).

In Kabul, the bomb went off near a gathering of hundreds of Shias singing at the Abu Fazal shrine.

Fifty-four people were killed in the blast, said health ministry spokesman Norughli Kargar, while 150 were injured.

""It was very loud. My ears went deaf and I was blown three metres [yards],"" Mustafa, who uses only one name, told Associated Press news agency.

""There was smoke and red blood on the floor of the shrine. There were people lying everywhere.""

Amid the chaos straight after the blast, a young girl, dressed in a green shalwar kameez (traditional dress) smeared in blood, stood shrieking, surrounded by the crumpled, piled-up bodies of children, AFP reported.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke of the unprecedented nature of the attack, saying it was ""the first time that, on such an important religious day in Afghanistan, terrorism of that horrible nature is taking place"".

No-one had claimed to have carried out the attacks, said Mohammad Zahir, head of Kabul's criminal investigation department.

A Taliban statement said the group had not been behind either incident.

Police said they foiled another attack elsewhere in the capital.
The bomb which exploded near the main mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif was apparently strapped to a bicycle, and went off shortly after the Kabul blast.

Balkh province Deputy Police Chief Abdul Raouf Taj said the device exploded as a convoy of Shias, shouting in celebration of Ashura, passed by, AP reported.

At least 17 people were injured.

Elsewhere, police said at least three people were wounded by a motorcycle bomb in the southern city of Kandahar, the Taliban's heartland - but it appears to have been unconnected to the other two attacks.

Rarity
Mohammad Bakir Shaikzada, the top Shiite cleric in Kabul, said he could not remember a similar attack on such a scale.

""This is a crime against Muslims during the holy day of Ashura,"" he told AP.

""We Muslims will never forget these attacks. It is the enemy of the Muslims who are carrying them out,"" he said, though he would not speculate on who might be responsible.

There are tensions between Sunni and minority Shia Muslims in Afghanistan, but violence of the type seen in Pakistan or Iraq is rare, the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says.

Over the past decade Shias in Afghanistan have celebrated their festivals more confidently, openly and on a bigger scale than ever before.

The attacks come a day after an international conference on Afghanistan's future was held, in the German city of Bonn.

Pakistan boycotted the conference, after a Nato attack killed 24 of its troops at a checkpoint near the Afghan border last month.

Afghan security officials held their breath during the conference, our correspondent says, fearing there might an attack in Kabul to divert attention.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16046079

Al-Jazeera says the Afghan ministry of health reports more than 100 people were injured.

Another four people were reportedly killed and more were injured in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif by a similar attack. Al-Jazeera adds that:

""The blasts occurred as Shias gathered to carry out religious rituals to mark one of the most significant days in their calendar. Ashoura, a public holiday in Afghanistan, is the Shia day of mourning commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.""

Afghanistan is a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation. The Associated Press calls today's attacks ""an unprecedented wave of violence against the minority Islamic sect in Afghanistan. ... Religiously motivated attacks on Shiites are rare in Afghanistan although they are common in neighboring Pakistan. No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blasts, reminiscent of the wave of sectarian attacks that shook Iraq during the height of the war there.""

The BBC notes that ""though tensions exist between Afghanistan's Sunni and minority Shia Muslims, most attacks in Afghanistan in recent years have targeted government officials or international forces.""

The Guardian writes of the Kabul blast that ""one witness, Rohullah, 21, who saw the explosion from a nearby rooftop, said it had sent bodies and limbs flying into the air. ... Stunned and tearful locals milled around the scene of the attack as loudspeakers still played recorded verses of the Qur'an.""

Witnesses say the Kabul blast was set off by a man wearing a backpack apparently filled with explosives. In Mazar-i-Sharif, the AP says, it's thought that the bomb was ""strapped to a bicycle"" and exploded as a convoy of vehicles carrying Shiites passed by.

	Smoke billowed from the direction of the German embassy, while explosions from rocket-propelled grenades slammed into nearby buildings in the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood of Kabul, the diplomatic quarter of the Afghan capital.

	Gunfire appeared to be coming from various directions in the barricaded and closely guarded area of the city, close to the US and British embassies, as well as the Turkish and Iranian missions, witnesses said, adding that alarm sirens had gone off.

	Afghan security forces were reportedly scrambling to reinforce the so-called 'green zone.' Some people in the area said they had heard at least a dozen explosions.

	A newly-built hotel, the Kabul Star, was said to be on fire in an area, which also includes the Afghan presidential palace and the United Nations office. According to unverified accounts, due to the chaotic situation, witnesses have reportedly said that suicide bombers have taken over the hotel, from which they launched their rockets and gunfire in several directions.

	The German news agency, dpa, quoting an Afghan interior ministry spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said two separate incidents were ongoing in the capital.

	""Armed insurgents are launching attacks in two areas of Kabul, but we have surrounded the area and deployed a heavy number of security forces in the area to contain the gunfight,"" Sediqqi said.

	The local Tolonews television channel reported that there was another attack near the Afghan parliament, west of Kabul.

	Taliban militants claimed responsibility for the attacks and said that simultaneously others were taking place in Paktia and Logar provinces as well.

“The terrorists’ infiltration in Kabul and other provinces is an intelligence failure for us and especially for NATO and should be seriously investigated,” Karzai said in a statement on Monday.

The president however, praised the “bravery and sacrifice of the security forces who quickly and timely reacted to contain the terrorists”.

In his first reaction after the series of attacks targeting Western embassies and NATO bases, which continued till Monday morning, Karzai said that “Afghan security forces proved to the people that they can defend their country successfully”.

Gun battles between Afghan security forces and Taliban fighters in the capital, Kabul, ended after almost 18 hours of fierce fighting, according to government and police officials.

“The latest information we have about the Afghan parliament area is that the attack is over now and the only insurgent who was resisting has been killed,” Hashmatullah Stanikzai, the Kabul police chief’s spokesman, said on Monday.

There were conflicting reports regarding the number of casualties in the co-ordinated attacks that targeted mainly western installations in Kabul, which the Taliban described as the launch of a “spring offensive”.

Afghanistan’s defence ministry said 32 gunmen and three Afghan soldiers were killed in the operation against the multiple assaults, Reuters news agency reported.

But Bismillah Mohammadi, the Afghan interior minister, said 36 fighters, eight members of security forces and three civilians were killed and 44 others wounded in the gun battle, the AFP news agency reported.

Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, said: “They [Taliban] have been able to strike right in the heart of the city, supposedly the most well protected part of Afghanistan.”“There are now of course, serious questions about intelligence failings that allowed the Taliban to effectively lay siege of the city for almost 18 hours,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/4/16/karzai-wants-intelligence-failure-probed

 — 
A series of explosions rocked central Kabul early Monday, the day after Afghan security forces said they repulsed a wave of insurgent attacks in the capital and three other provinces.

The explosions persisted for some time, and followed periodic gunfire that lasted well into Sunday night in the Kabul district that houses government offices and allied embassies. There was no immediate explanation, but Afghan authorities had said late Sunday that they were trying to dislodge insurgents holed up in an empty building near the headquarters of NATO’s International Security Assistance Force.

Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said the remaining insurgents “have no choice except surrendering or to be killed by the Afghan forces.”

“They came today with more than 20 insurgents and suicide bombers and attacked four provinces,” Seddiqi told CNN Sunday. “As a result, they got nothing, and 19 of them were killed.”

The assault was a rare occurrence in a heavily guarded part of Kabul – but Gen. John Allen, the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, said the Afghans beat back the insurgents without allied assistance.

“They were on scene immediately, well-led and well-coordinated,” Allen said. “They integrated their efforts, helped protect their fellow citizens and largely kept the insurgents contained.” He said the attacks were meant to signal “that legitimate governance and Afghan sovereignty are in peril,” but the Afghan response “is proof enough of that folly.”Seddiqi said two civilians were killed across the country, and 15 Afghan police officers were wounded. He said 15 of 19 suicide bombers were stopped before they could blow themselves up, with most of them killed by Afghan security forces.

And Lutfullah Mashal, a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, said three men arrested in Kabul confessed to plotting to kill Karim Khalil, Afghanistan’s second vice president. Two of the men planned to blow themselves up in Khalil’s home, Mashal said.

The Taliban militia that once ruled most of Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying it launched fighters into battle with suicide vests, RPGs and hand grenades in Kabul and the provinces of Nangarhar, Paktia and Logar. But Mashal said the three men who targeted Khalil confessed to being members of the Haqqani network, a separate insurgent group that sometimes allies itself with the Taliban.

In his statement, Allen said, “No one is underestimating the seriousness of today’s attacks.” But ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings described himself as “underwhelmed,” and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told CNN, “The Taliban are very good at issuing statements, less good at fighting.”

Crocker told CNN’s “State of the Union” that no Americans had been hurt, but “our hearts go out” to the Afghans who had been killed or wounded. He suggested the attacks may be the work of the Haqqani network, rather than the Taliban, saying the Taliban did not have the capacity to carry them out.

NATO’s International Security Assistance Force said as many as seven locations in Kabul were attacked, including Afghanistan’s parliament building and the American, German and Russian embassies. Seddiqi said the insurgents took up positions in empty buildings in three Kabul districts to carry out the attacks, and still held one as midnight neared Sunday. Kabul police said they found and detonated a van full of explosives.

Meanwhile, an airbase used by U.S. troops in the eastern city of Jalalabad, in Naranghar province, also came under attack, the NATO command in Kabul reported. Four suicide bombers wearing women’s burqas tried to attack the Jalalabad airfield where United States troops are based, airfield commander Jahangir Azimi said.

At least three of the attackers were killed, ISAF said in a statement about the incident.

The Taliban are very good at issuing statements, less good at fighting.

U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker

Separately, a group of suicide bombers attacked the police training center in the city of Gardez, in nearby Paktia province. At least eight civilians were wounded, said a police official at the center, who is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named.

And 15 would-be attackers were arrested in Kunduz province plotting similar strikes, said Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the chief of police for north and northeast Afghanistan.

The Taliban, the Islamist militia that once ruled most of Afghanistan, said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of 17 Afghan civilians in Kandahar province last month. A U.S. Army staff sergeant, Robert Bales, has been charged with those killings.

But Jeff Dressler, an expert on the Haqqani network at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, told CNN that the coordination seen in the Kabul attacks indicate a Haqqani-led network was behind them, and that planned but disrupted attacks in the north may also be Haqqani-linked.

“This is likely their unofficial announcement marking the start of the spring fighting season,” Dressler said. Though the attacks didn’t succeed, he said, “The target selection was likely intended to send a message to the U.S., U.K., Russia and the Afghans that this will in fact be a bloody year for all forces in Afghanistan, particularly the east of the country.”

U.S. Embassy spokesman Gavin Sundwall said he could not confirm that the embassy itself was the target of the attacks, but said gunfire had been heard in the vicinity. In a statement from London, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the British Embassy was one of the targets, but “every member of Embassy staff is safe.”

“The Afghan National Security Forces responded to the attacks bravely, promptly and effectively, once again illustrating the significant progress that has been made in ensuring that Afghans can look after their own security,” Hague said. The embassy premises sustained “limited damage,” he said, and its staff “dealt with this dangerous situation extremely professionally.”

India also said it had no reports of its nationals being wounded.

A local police official said attackers took over a central Kabul hotel close to the presidential palace, United Nations office and many foreign embassies, but both Seddiqi and staff at the hotel denied it had been attacked.

A western official in Kabul later said the hotel had been taken over by insurgents, but was then taken back by Afghan national security forces.",https://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/15/world/asia/afghanistan-violence/index.html

There were also reports of attacks in the two eastern cities of Gardez and Jalalabad.

The Afghan government said it had surrounded the locations in the capital occupied by the militants and had the situation under control.

The first sign of trouble in Kabul came when explosions erupted in the Akbar Khan neighborhood housing a number of diplomatic missions and NATO headquarters. This was followed almost immediately by gunfire, with smoke seen rising from several buildings on a brisk spring day as sirens screamed. Heavy gunfire continued for at least 30 minutes after the initial blasts.

Militants in a tall building fired rockets in several directions, the Associated Press reported, with some apparently focused on the nearby British Embassy. About the same time, the German and Russian embassies also reportedly came under fire.

The U.S. Embassy entered lockdown status on hearing the explosions and gunfire, spokesman Gavin Sundwall said, which he described as standard operating procedure in such situations, adding that all personnel were accounted for and safe.

This was followed by reports of a blast and gunfire near the parliament building on the other side of Kabul, with Turkish forces at their base on Kabul’s outskirts as well as an Afghan military academy also reportedly coming under direct mortar attack. All told, about seven sites were targeted, said NATO’s International Security Assistance Force, adding that it had no immediate information on the number of confirmed casualties.

Interior Ministry spokesman Sadiq Saddqui told Afghan television that three insurgents were killed near the Kabul Star Hotel, adding that there was a standoff at a building in the neighborhood. In Jalalabad, there were reports of four suicide attackers targeting the Jalalabad airfield housing U.S. troops. Local police said one blew himself up and three were intercepted.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the coordinated assault, which it said was part of its spring offensive involving dozens of suicide bombers in Kabul and three provinces around the nation equipped with suicide vests and rocket propelled grenades.

The coordinated attacks serve the Taliban’s interests in at least two ways, analysts said. It aims to help push foreign troops out of the country before 2014, the announced date for NATO to hand over security to Afghan forces, knowing that foreign governments are increasingly weary of the war’s cost in lost lives and money.

A number of those killed on Tuesday were foreign workers for an international courier company, a senior police source said,Â and oneÂ was an Afghan translator.
â€œAt around 6:45am [0215 GMT] a suicide bomber using a sedan blew himself up along the airport road in District 15. As a result, nine workers of a foreign company and three Afghan civilians are dead, and two police are wounded,â€ police said in a statement.
Kabul police chief Mohammad Ayoub SalangiÂ said the bomber blew herself up alongside a minivan, carrying foreigners.
â€œThis [attack] happened on a busy main road just on the edge of the centre of the city of Kabul near the cityâ€™s airport,â€ said Al Jazeeraâ€™s Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul.Â 
â€œWe are told that the woman-driven explosive laden vehicle hit a small vehicle, perhaps a minibus, carrying foreign workers in that area.
â€œWe understand that some of those foreigners [killed] are South Africans who work for a charter airline company,â€ he said.
A spokesman for NATOâ€™s US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) confirmed an explosion near the airport, but said there was no current report of casualties among its personnel.
Claims of responsibility
Armed group, Hizb-e-Islami, on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out by a woman to avenge the controversial video deemed insulting to Islam.
The claim was made by spokesman Zubair Sidiqi in a telephone call to AFP news agency from an undisclosed location.

Hizb-e-Islami

Afghanistanâ€™s second-biggest armed group after the Taliban.
Thousands of fighters and followers across the north and east of the country.
Not aligned with the Taliban, but is against what it calls the US â€œoccupationâ€.
Led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, 65, a former warlord.
Hekmatyar is a former Afghan prime minister and one-time US ally during the war against the Soviet occupation, but is now listed as a terrorist by Washington.
Group was reportedly funded by Pakistanâ€™s ISI against the Soviets.


It is extremely rare for the faction to claim a suicide attack in Afghanistan, and even rarerÂ for women to carry out suicide attacks.
Hizb-e-Islami is Afghanistanâ€™s second-biggest armed group after the Taliban and is led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a former warlord.
The group, which has thousands of fighters and followers across the north and east of the country, is not aligned with the Taliban, but it is against what it calls the US occupation.
Its 65-year-old leader is a former Afghan prime minister and one-time US ally during the war against the Soviet occupation, but is now listed as a terrorist by Washington.
This radical Islamist group was reportedly funded by Pakistanâ€™s ISI against the Soviets.
â€œWe have also had the Taliban confirming to us that Hizb-e-Islami is responsible for this attack,â€ said Al Jazeeraâ€™s Smith.
â€œAs far as we understand this is the first time that this group has used a suicide bomber. It is also extraordinarily unusual that the suicide bomber is woman,â€ he said.
Witnesses said there was smoke spewing into the sky and a heavy police deployment at the scene of the attack, contributing to a major traffic snarl-up on the busy road.
The attack came a day after protests turned violent for the first time in Afghanistan over the film Innocence of Muslims, as hundreds of angry men hurled stones at a US military base, clashed with police and shouted â€œDeath to Americaâ€.
Tuesdayâ€™s attack also followed a devastating few days for NATO in which six of its soldiers were shot dead by suspected Afghan police, the Taliban destroyed six US fighter jets in an unprecedented assault on a major base in the south and one of its air strikes killed eight Afghan women.

Taliban groups took responsibility for both attacks.

In the first one, a 22-year-old woman named Fatima drove a car packed with 660 pounds (300 kilograms) of explosives into a van on a road leading to Kabul International Airport, according to Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, a group allied with the Taliban that took responsibility for the attack.

The blast killed 12 people and wounded 11 others, government officials said.

Video footage of the aftermath showed a charred vehicle smoldering on the road as military officials milled about the blast site.

Eight of the dead were South Africans, a government spokesman confirmed, all working for an international flight provider, some of them as pilots.

Three of the dead were Afghan civilians, and another was a citizen of Kyrgyzstan, Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s office said.

Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin said the attack was revenge for an anti-Islam film that has angered the Muslim world.

The South Africans were ethnic Caucasians, said Clayson Monyela from South Africa’s International Relations Department, who suggested they could have been mistaken for Westerners associated with U.S. or NATO military powers.

General: Quarter of Afghan insider attacks by Taliban

South Africa not only has no troops in Afghanistan but also has no consulate or embassy, Monyela said.

The International Relations Department issued a statement saying it was working to confirm the identities of the dead and notify their relatives.

Karzai condemned the attacks, saying in a statement that those behind it were “thirsty of blood” and an “enemy of mankind.”

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul also condemned the attack.

“This vicious attack again shows that the insurgents have no respect for human life,” the embassy said.

In Kunar province, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed an Afghan civilian and wounded four people, including three International Security Assistance Force troops, according to Wasifullah Wasifi, a spokesman for the provincial governor’s office.

They were working on a bridge repair project, Wasifi said.

Lt. Col. Hagen Messer, spokesman for the NATO-led force, confirmed the incident and that NATO troops had been injured.

U.S. restricts operations after insider attacks

The use of a female car bomber in the Kabul attack is an anomaly in Afghanistan, where women are usually not allowed to drive, and may highlight a recent increase in the use of tactics by the Taliban to avoid detection beforehand.

Afghan insurgents who staged a daring, well-planned raid Friday on Camp Bastion, the military base where Britain’s Prince Harry is serving, were wearing U.S. Army uniforms.

It’s rare for Afghan insurgents to don U.S. uniforms for their attacks. The last time CNN can identify the tactic was in August 2010 when NATO repelled attacks on two bases in Khost province.

Though seldom used, such tactics are not new to the Taliban, said documentary filmmaker Mehran Bozorghmia, who has filmed the Taliban. “These sort of plannings were going on three years ago.”

Recent green-on-blue attacks, in which Afghan army troops open fire on allied International Security Assistance Force soldiers, represent yet another cloaking tactic in the Islamist militia’s clandestine game, Bozorghmia says. The Taliban “have sleepers inside the army.”

Such insiders could have also gained access to the U.S. Army uniforms that insurgents wore in Friday’s attack.

Tuesday’s attack is another violent response to an online film, produced in the United States, that mocks Islam’s holy prophet. Protests started last week, including an attack at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Washington has made it clear it did not sanction the low-budget, amateurish 14-minute movie trailer posted on YouTube and produced privately in the United States. The clip, which has been banned by YouTube in several countries, mocks the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer.",https://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/18/world/asia/afghanistan-attack/index.html

Eight South Africans were among the dead, according to the country's international affairs ministry. Afghan police and airport sources said the South African victims worked for Aviation Charter Solutions (ACS), a company providing planes and helicopters for the US embassy and its aid programme.

Government documents show the firm was awarded a $360m, two-year contract by USAid in January 2010, that could be extended further.The embassy declined to comment when asked about the attack, and possible links with ACS.

Hizb-i-Islami, a militant group connected to the Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in revenge for an anti-Islam film that has spawned rioting from north Africa to south-east Asia, including violent protests in Kabul on Monday.

The attacker, who used an explosives-rigged Toyota Corolla, was a 22-year-old woman named Fatima, the group said in an email to the Associated Press.

It was almost impossible to verify the claim in the immediate aftermath; little remained of the car beyond scraps of metal and a charred engine. If true, it would be the first time militants have deployed a female suicide bomber in the Afghan capital.

The attack happened at 6.45am as the bus drove down the main highway to Kabul's airport where all the victims worked, police said. The bus regularly stopped at the same petrol station to refuel around that time of the morning, said one policeman, who asked not to be named.

Witnesses said an Afghan child aged around eight and a worker who changed tyres were among the dead. Most of the bodies piled up around the blast site appeared to be Caucasian; the blond hair of one worker was clearly visible.

""I heard a huge explosion and came running out of my house,"" said 22-year-old Hussain, who lives nearby. ""I thought maybe there had been a rocket attack, but on the road I saw some badly destroyed bodies, legs, hands. A vehicle was burning, and I couldn't bear the sight, so I left.""

The glass front of the newly completed Khalija wedding hall nearby had been blown out, while the City wedding hall had also lost some windowsand cars on the other side of the road were badly damaged.

The timing of the attack may have limited casualties. Later in the day the road is packed with people commuting to work, and to and from the airport.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/afghanistan-suicide-blast-kills-12

The bomb went off near a compound where tribal elders are expected to gather next week to discuss a security pact with the US.

The Taliban have told the BBC they carried out the attack.

The security pact governs the status of US military personnel staying in Afghanistan beyond the withdrawal of most international forces in 2014.

It will be discussed next week by Afghanistan's Loya Jirga, the traditional council of elders.

Immunity
Those killed in Saturday's attack include a police officer. Many of the other casualties appear to have been civilians.Police say the attacker crashed a vehicle filled with explosives into an Afghan army vehicle when soldiers identified it as a threat and opened fire.

The blast occurred less than 100m from a large tent where more than 2,000 prominent Afghans will gather on Thursday to debate the security pact with the US.

The security agreement must be approved by the Loya Jirga and parliament before it can come into force.

Among other issues, the pact covers the key issue of whether US military personnel will enjoy immunity from prosecution in Afghanistan.

Hours before the blast, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said negotiators had completed a draft of the accord, the Associated Press news agency reports. But he added that there were ""still some differences"".

The president also called on the Taliban to attend the Loya Jirga.

""We invite them, please come to this national Jirga of Afghanistan, raise your voice, raise your objection.""

Between 5,000 and 10,000 US military personnel are due to remain in the country beyond the end of 2014, when most of the Nato-led international force is due to have left Afghanistan.

The US is expected to focus on training and mentoring Afghan security forces as well as combating al-Qaeda.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24970622

At least six people were killed and 22 wounded in the blast, said Sediq Sediqqi, an Interior Ministry spokesman. He said the casualties were a mix of soldiers and civilians.

The blast occurred shortly after 3 p.m., fewer than 100 metres (yards) from a huge tent where more than 2,000 prominent Afghans are due to gather, a Reuters witness said.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

One man fleeing the bombing, Mohammad Amin, looked dazed as he described to Reuters seeing a white Totoya Corolla vehicle speed towards a police checkpoint and then explode.

Covered in blood and dust, he said he was standing across the street behind his parked car when the blast occurred.

“Thank God my car protected me because it was so close. My ears are still ringing,” Amin said.

A Reuters reporter saw at least six wounded people, as well as a large unchecked fire and numerous smashed cars.

A Kabul police spokesman, Hashmat Stanekzai, said earlier there were at least 15 dead and wounded as a result of the attack, but could not immediately provide more detail.A loya jirga is a traditional Afghan meeting convened to debate matters of national importance and includes thousands of tribal elders, politicians and other elites.

For almost a year, Washington and Kabul have been seeking to conclude a Bilateral Security Agreement that will help determine how many U.S. soldiers and bases remain in Afghanistan after most foreign combat troops exit by the end of next year.

The lack of agreement has raised the prospect that Washington may yet pull out all of its troops next year unless differences are ironed out.

Senior U.S. and NATO officials said last month they were confident Afghanistan’s elders and parliament would back the deal allowing American troops to stay after 2014.

Two years ago, the United States ended its military mission in Iraq with a similar “zero option” outcome after the failure of talks with Baghdad.

Earlier on Saturday, Karzai called on the Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency against his government and U.S.-led forces for over a decade, to put down their guns and participate in the assembly.

“We hope by all means that they participate in the Loya Jirga,” said Karzai, who is keen to find a negotiated political solution to years of fighting with the Taliban. “They are our countrymen and they have the right to be part of such meetings.”

“I once again invite them to please come and participate in the people’s national meeting.”

Four gunmen were swift as they entered the Serena Hotel, a luxury lodging in Kabul, although it took them a few minutes to find the restaurant that was their target. Afghan officials pieced together the details of a Thursday attack that left nine people dead, including four foreigners and two children who were shot in the head.
The Afghan capital has been hit by several attacks, but authorities appeared stunned that the fighters had managed to get through tight security at the Serena HotelÂ â€” considered one of the safest places to stay in Kabul.
Among the dead was Sardar Ahmad, 40, an Afghan journalist for Agence France-Presse, killed along with his wife and two of his children, the French news agency confirmed. It said the family's youngest son was undergoing emergency treatment after being badly wounded in the attack.
Ahmad also ran the Kabul Pressistan media company and joined AFP in 2003 to become the agency's senior reporter in Kabul. He covered all aspects of life, war and politics in his native Afghanistan, according to a statement tweeted by the agency.
In response, an association of reporters in the country, the Afghan Journalist Family, imposed a 15-day boycott of Taliban-related coverage.Â 
""The Taliban carry out such attacks, which can never be justified, solely for the purposes of news coverage and projecting terror among Afghan citizens,"" the journalist group wrote on Facebook, according to ABC News, which is a member of the organization.Â ""We also ask the Taliban for an explanation of how they justify the shooting from a close-range of innocent children.""Â 
The shooting spree is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks as the Taliban and allied fighters step up a campaign of violence before national elections on April 5.
It comes on the heels of an uptick in bombings and shootings targeting foreigners in Kabul, something that had been relatively rare. Earlier this month, a Swedish journalist was shot on the street execution-style, and a Lebanese restaurant popular with foreigners was attacked by a suicide bomber and gunmen in January.
The attacks show the Taliban are following through on their threat to use violence to disrupt next month's elections. The presidential vote will be the first democratic transfer of power since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the Islamic militant movement. President Hamid Karzai is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group claimed responsibility for the hotel attack, saying it shows that ""our people, if they decide to attack any place, they can do it.""
The restaurant in the Serena Hotel was packed with Afghans celebrating the eve of the Persian New Year, Nowruz, as well as foreigners who frequent the hotel.
Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said most of the civilians were killed when two of the attackers walked into the restaurant and began shooting, while the others were shot to death as the gunmen made their way through the hotel. Police killed all four attackers after a three-hour standoff, with shooting resounding through the cordoned-off streets outside.
He said the four foreigners killed were from Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan and India, but the New Zealand and Pakistani foreign ministries denied any of their citizens were among the dead. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement that a woman from New Zealand was in the Serena at the time of the attack but was unharmed. Islamabad said no Pakistani nationals were killed.
Afghan authorities have released a series of conflicting statements since the attack began Thursday night, citing the chaos and the need to focus on protecting hotel guests.
The attackers reached the hotel at 8:30 p.m., evading security checks by hiding small pistols and ammunition in their socks and the soles of their shoes, Sediqqi said.
Afghan authorities initially said only two security guards had been wounded and the assault began at 6 p.m. but later changed their account.
The attackers appeared to be about 18 years old, and all were killed, Sediqqi said at a press conference, displaying photos of the small pistols and ammunition the attackers used and shoes in which they hid their weapons.
In other violence, an explosion struck a Nowruz ceremony, killing three people in the southern province of Kandahar on Friday.
Police spokesman Zia Durani said fighters threw an explosives-packed bottle that blew up when it landed, which he called a new tactic.
Those killed included the head of the provincial media center and two policemen, Durani said, adding that seven other people were wounded.

Nine Killed In Attack On Kabul's Serena Hotel
","

Updated

March 21, 2014

","
Authorities in Afghanistan say at least nine civilians -- including four women and two children -- have been killed in a shooting attack at Kabul's luxury Serena Hotel.

Four foreign nationals -- from Canada, Paraguay, and two Bangladeshis, including a dual U.S.-Bangladeshi citizen -- were among the dead.

French news agency AFP said its Kabul reporter Sardar Ahmad, his wife, and two of his three children died in the attack.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has offered his condolences to Ahmad's relatives ""and all Afghan press.""

All four of the attackers were reported killed in the ensuing shoot-out with Afghan security forces.

The heavily fortified Serena Hotel is used by UN staff and has been a frequent target of insurgent attacks.

Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said the ""underage"" attackers ""were able to hide...pistols in their socks, and at 9 o'clock they started shooting at some of the personnel of the hotel.""

A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said that group's militants were responsible for the assault, and claimed the attackers had fired at foreign and Afghan guests celebrating the Afghan new year.

The Taliban has vowed a campaign of violence to disrupt the country's presidential election on April 5.

The Serena is regarded as among the most secure hotels in Kabul, with multiple layers of security.

A suicide bomber attacked the same hotel in 2008, killing six people.

Analysts say the Serena attack is likely to lead to a spike in security concerns among foreigners in Afghanistan, some of whom will be involved in independent missions to monitor the elections.

In January, 21 people, including 13 foreigners -- among them United Nations staffers and an IMF official -- were killed in a Taliban assault on a popular Lebanese restaurant in Kabul.

Herve Rouach, deputy editor in chief of the AFP news agency, called the killing of the agency's reporter Ahmad a ""very great loss.""

""He was one of our best journalists in Afghanistan and you know how crucial it is for us to have good journalists in country like Afghanistan [in order] to have a good coverage,"" Rouach told RFE/RL's Radio Free Afghanistan.

Ahmad's death followed the slaying earlier this month of Nils Horner, a journalist for Swedish Radio, who was shot dead by a group claiming to be a Taliban offshoot.

Sumit Galhotra, a research associate for the Committee to Protect Journalists, says militant attacks have been increasing and Kabul has to be seen as an unsafe environment for journalists and foreigners.

""It is [an] unsafe climate for foreigners, including diplomats, journalists who are operating there and [it] just shows the chaos and the instability that exists in the lead-up to the election,"" Galhotra says.

The presidential election is being held with the Afghan government preparing to assume control of security duties across the country as most U.S.-led combat forces withdraw by the end of this year.

Earlier on March 20, a suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan left 18 people dead, including 10 police officers, one civilian, and the seven attackers.

Fourteen police officers were also wounded in that attack, which targeted a police station in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province.

Photograph: David GillTheir most prominent victim was Afghan journalist Sardar Ahmad, who worked for Agence France Press and had his own media company. Ahmad's wife and two daughters were also killed, and his toddler son is now fighting for his life in hospital.Tributes to him and his work poured in from colleagues, politicians including the former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and readers in Afghanistan and beyond. ""My dear Sardar rest in peace! Fuck you terrorists you bloody killed my best friend with all his family,"" Parwiz Shamal, a journalist with TOLO, an Afghan television station, said on Twitter. The foreign victims were from New Zealand, Canada, India and Pakistan, said Sediqqi, but he did not release names or any other details.The attackers were armed only with six tiny handguns, barely bigger than cigarette packets, but shooting went on for over two hours as security forces hunted down the last attacker, who hid inside toilets at the sprawling hotel complex. Hundreds of staff and guests took refuge in a cavernous bunker, while others were evacuated from the building.The last person rescued, Sediqqi said, was the gunmen's first target. A senator who had been dining with three other legislators hurled glasses at the young attackers and escaped into a nearby garden where he hid for four hours, injured but alive. The other three all survived the attack unharmed.The Serena had been one of the few places in Afghanistan where both foreigners and the country's elite could relax and enjoy rare luxuries such as a swimming pool and 24-hour electricity. Tight layers of security including armed guards, multiple steel gates, metal detectors and x-ray machines made the five-star hotel feel safe even though it had been hit by an attack in 2008 that killed seven people.Thursday's attackers apparently hid handguns and bullets, wrapped in blue tissue paper and hidden under in the soles of their chunky shoes.They were all young men, with fake ID cards from southern Kandahar province with their ages given as between 19 and 25, although in pictures taken after the attack they looked barely out of their teens.They had told guards on the door that they were going to the restaurant for dinner, the interior ministry spokesman said, although the government is investigating why their guns were not discovered during security checks.The attack may drive some election monitors away. At least one mission was reportedly packing up just hours after the attack. Others said that while the deaths were tragic, violence was a risk in any country at war and they would continue with their mission.""If you go to Afghanistan, a country where in the last year thousands of incidents have taken place, you cannot let yourself be influenced by the next incident,"" said Thijs Berman, a member of the European parliament and head of the EU election-monitoring mission.He added that his team had a commitment to millions of Afghans risking their lives to organise and participate in the vote.

But Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi was very specific in blaming Pakistan for a ceasefire in the frontier region during the Afghan election campaign, our correspondent says.

	At least nine civilians were killed during an assault by four gunmen on Thursday night at a luxury hotel in Kabul, a spokesman for Afghanistan's interior ministry said on Friday.

	The gunmen, believed to have been around 18 years of age, entered Kabul's Serena hotel with pistols hidden in their socks and opened fire in the hotel restaurant. All four men were killed in the ensuing standoff with Afghan security forces.

	The hotel is popular with foreign visitors and is heavily fortified.

	Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told a news conference in Kabul that four of the victims were foreign nationals; from Canada, New Zealand, India and Pakistan.

	The attack, claimed by the Taliban, comes just weeks before Afghanistan's presidential election on April 5, and Sediqqi said the motive was clear.

	""We believe that such attacks have a direct link to the upcoming elections, and the enemies try to stage such attacks to frustrate the people of Afghanistan about their future,"" he said.

	Maintaining security is seen as a huge test of Afghan forces abilities as foreign troops wind down their combat mission at the end of this year.

The attackers tried to break into a complex known as the Green Village on Wednesday, starting with the explosion of a van at the gate of the heavily guarded area in eastern Kabul that houses foreign contractors and various facilities.

Security forces repelled them after about an hour of fighting and no casualties were reported among the area's residents, officials said.

Attacks on foreign troops, Afghan government officials and security forces have intensified as the international military coalition ends operations, leaving the fight against the Taliban insurgency mostly to Afghan forces.

""Four suicide bombers have been killed, there was no harm to civilians,"" said deputy interior minister General Ayoub Salangi.

It was not immediately clear how the attackers died.

""Since the Green Village had been targeted several times in the past, the place was heavily guarded and the attackers failed to reach their intended target. Only one guard was wounded,"" interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi added.

The Afghan Taliban, ousted from power by a US-led coalition in 2001, have been staging almost daily attacks in Kabul and claimed responsibility for the latest assault.

""Suicide bombers attacked the invading forces' base called the Green Village,"" their spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said by text message.

""The attack began with blowing up a car packed with explosives and other fighters, armed with heavy and light weapons, arrived at the area and started the gunfight.""

A Western security source at the Green Village said there had been between four and six explosions.

Another Western security source said the attackers failed to get inside but their grenades went over the wall and hit Green Village premises.

They may have also fired rocket-propelled grenades, the source said.

The Green Village is one of Kabul's most heavily guarded compounds, surrounded by layers of tall grey blast walls and multiple security checkpoints.

Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the early-morning blast, which shook windows across the Afghan capital and sent a plume of smoke into the sky over the east of the city.

After the initial explosion, two other militants were shot dead as they tried to storm the compound.

“It was a bomb in a small truck at the gate of a foreign base. Initial reports show two guards killed, several wounded,” Najib Danish, deputy spokesman for the ministry of interior, told AFP.

“The guards were Afghan. Two other attackers tried to enter the base and were killed by guards.”

Kabul police chief Zahir Zahir said the attackers drove a truck carrying sand and stone up the compound gate, claiming they were delivering construction material.

He said one foreign national was wounded, but gave no further details.

Vice-president Abdul Rahshid Dostum arrived at the scene shortly after the blast.

“This is not a face-to-face war, it is an intelligence war,” he told reporters.

“We all know they (the Taliban) have influence over some traitors... but we will find them and they will be brought to justice.”

A spokesman for the Taliban said via a recognised Twitter account that the attack targeted a foreign forces’ intelligence base.

On Sunday Afghan lawmaker Shukria Barakzai escaped a suicide blast in Kabul as she drove in a convoy near parliament.

Three civilians died in that attack.

Kabul has been hit by regular suicide attacks over recent years, often against the US-led military force fighting Taliban insurgents since 2001.

Four Taliban assailants including a suicide bomber died in the failed attack on the Green Village, the area in the eastern part of the Afghan capital home to hundreds of United Nations staff, security contractors and a few remaining CIA personnel.

Hashmat Stanikzai, a Kabul police spokesman, confirmed that a vehicle full of explosives had detonated in the Pol-e Charkhi area, at the gate of Green Village, and that the security forces had killed the remaining three attackers. He said that no security forces or civilians had been killed, but emphasised that he was providing “temporary details”.
A senior UN official who was present at the time of the attack said he heard three, possibly four “very, very loud explosions” over the course of 30 minutes. The first explosion, which occurred around 9pm local time, was a suicide bomber.

“There was a car that entered the first gate at the Green Village, that was a suicide car,” said the UN official. Following the explosion, gunfire erupted and lasted for “at least 20 minutes”, in which three other attackers were killed.

“People are alarmed,” the official said. “For many people it’s the first experience of a direct personal attack.”

In a phone interview, Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, took responsibility for the attack. “The target was the Green Village because foreigners use the Green Village as a safe house,” he said.

The Green Village lies several kilometres to the east of downtown Kabul, but that has not dissuaded militants from attacking the heavily fortified complex in the past. Wednesday’s attack was the third on the Green Village in as many years.

The attack comes after a string of recent assaults in Kabul, which have helped intensify a months-long Taliban offensive following the beginning of the withdrawal of foreign troops and the recent presidential elections.

On Tuesday, a truck bomb killed two members of the Afghan security forces at a base for foreign forces, also in the Pol-e Charkhi area. And on Sunday, a prominent female MP, Shukria Barakzai, had a close brush with a suicide attacker on her way to parliament. Three civilians were killed and 20 wounded in the attack, while Barakzai was hospitalised.

The attack on the Green Village ended an hour after it started. At 11pm, UN staff were permitted to leave the Green Village bunkers.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/19/taliban-militants-dead-foreign-workers-kabul

A British national was killed in an attack on an embassy vehicle in the Afghan capital.

Mohammad SharifNovember 27, 2014
KABUL — A suicide bomber attacked a British Embassy ­vehicle in the eastern part of the Afghan capital Thursday morning, killing six, including a ­British citizen, and injuring more than 30, according to law enforcement officials.

Ten hours later, a suicide bomber and two gunmen attacked a foreign guesthouse near the compound of the International Relief and Development Organization, a humanitarian agency based in Arlington. The bomber detonated his explosives near the guesthouse as the gunmen tried to enter the compound in the affluent enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan, home to several embassies and nongovernmental and media organizations.

But guards at the compound engaged in a firefight, driving away the gunmen, Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub ­Salangi told reporters at the scene. One of the gunmen was killed, and a Nepalese guard at the compound was injured, he added. No other foreigners were wounded or killed, he said. After the attack, all the foreigners were quickly evacuated.The two attacks were the latest in a spate of assaults targeting foreigners as most U.S. and international troops are preparing to withdraw by the end of the year. The Taliban asserted responsibility for both attacks, as it has for other bombings that have rocked the capital in recent weeks.

The attacks come during pivotal developments for Afghanistan’s future. This week, the ­nation’s parliament endorsed the signing of a bilateral security agreement, known as a BSA, that allows U.S. and international troops to remain after the end of the year. And next week, President Ashraf Ghani will travel to London for a donor conference at which he will seek billions of dollars in aid to develop the country, mired in an economic crisis.

“They want to show that, ­despite having signed BSA and being a partner with the U.S., security is not easy to come by,” said Sediq Sediqqi, an Afghan ­Interior Ministry spokesman, referring to the Taliban. “They want to show their presence. They want to demonstrate they have the strength to do this. Unfortunately, this winter they will try more of these attacks, and especially Kabul will be more a focus.”In the morning blast, which unfolded about 10 a.m., authorities said the attacker ­detonated a car filled with ­explosives near the British ­Embassy vehicle, transforming it into a mangled mass of steel. The explosion was heard miles away, and black smoke rose from the scene, which was about a mile from the bases where foreign contractors live.

“I heard a huge blast,” said Mohammad Omar, an Afghan guard working for a construction company with an office near the scene of the bombing. “I was dazed, but a few minutes later I saw three cars destroyed and many people wounded.”

Britain’s foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said in a statement that a British citizen belonging to the embassy’s civilian security team and an Afghan working for the embassy were killed. A second British member of the security team was injured.I condemn this appalling ­attack on innocent civilians ­supporting our diplomatic activity,” the statement said. “This outrage brings home to us once again the courage and perseverance of the people of Afghanistan and members of the international community who support them, who have lived together through decades of conflict.”

Gen. John F. Campbell, the American commander of the ­International Security Assistance Force, the NATO-led mission to help stabilize Afghanistan, also condemned the bombing, saying in a statement that “those who commit such murderous acts have no place in the future of this country.”

In a tweet, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that the “martyrdom attack targeted foreign invaders.”

The incident was the second time this week that foreigners have been attacked in a similar fashion in the same area. On Monday, two American soldiers, including one from Maryland’s Eastern Shore, were killed nearby when a bomb attached to a bicycle exploded as their convoy passed.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/suicide-bomber-targets-british-vehicle-in-afghanistan/2014/11/27/c4f77d36-7606-11e4-a755-e32227229e7b_story.html

Lockdown over terror attack

There was a heavy police presence following the attack and surrounding streets were locked down.

This latest terror attack came just hours after several people died in a suicide bombing on a British embassy vehicle. A Taliban militant drove his explosives-packed car into the vehicle, killing a Briton and five Afghan citizens.

Attacks across Kabul have increased in recent weeks as US-led NATO forces prepare to end their 13-year combat mission against Taliban insurgents in December.

The Taliban used a recognised Twitter account to say they were behind both attacks.

At least eight blasts have hit Kabul over the last 10 days.

There have been attacks on foreign compounds as well as a female Afghan member of parliament, who was injured in a suicide bombing that targeted her car.

Officials said the attacker’s Toyota Corolla threw the armoured car on to its side, on the highway connecting Kabul to Jalalabad. At least five people were killed in the attack, while more than 30 were injured.

The dead Briton was a security guard with the private security firm G4S. An Afghan employed by the British embassy was also among the dead, while another Briton is among the injured. The Taliban is reported to have claimed responsibility for the bombing.G4S, the world’s biggest security firm, confirmed that one of its staff had been killed in the blast and another injured.

The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he condemned the “appalling attack on innocent civilians supporting our diplomatic activity”.

Hours later, Taliban fighters staged an attack on the Wazir Akbar Khan district, which contains numerous foreign embassies and compounds housing international agencies. Witnesses described multiple explosions.

After years of conflict, Afghanistan’s capital remains, as Kabul’s police chief concedes, a city where militants can strike without warning. And suicide bombings, like the twin blasts today.

Officials said the first attack took place just after 10.20am local time. “I saw a Corolla car driven at high speed hit a car bearing a diplomatic registration plate,” said 16-year-old Mahbobullah Anwari, who works at an Afghan bakery 100 metres from the blast site.He told The Independent: “The collision was followed by a loud explosion and a plume of smoke. I saw people covered in blood screaming and running for cover.” He said the embassy vehicle had been “charred and mangled”. Mahbobullah said the owner of his bakery, Haji Azam, also suffered injuries in the attack and was left in coma.Kanishka Turkistani, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Public Health, said the injured included six children and two women. At least 38 people are thought to have been injured in the first attack. “Most of the injured are being treated for splinter injuries to head, chest and legs,” he said.The highway was reopened to traffic about seven hours after the bombing. Police and fire officials could be seen washing blood from the road.

Some body parts, including those of the attacker, were put in bags and taken away. Shops along the Kabul-Jalalabad road and petrol stations then reopened.

For those living in Kabul, it was another perilous day. The attack was the fourth on the Kabul-Jalalabad road and the ninth suicide attack in the city in the last two weeks. On Monday, two US soldiers were killed in a bombing further down the road in eastern Kabul. Afghan security officials often accuse Pakistani intelligence agencies of providing logistics support to Taliban fighters. Those claims are strongly rebutted by the Pakistani government.

Security experts say the spate of recent attacks in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan is intended to create a climate of fear as the US and its coalition partners withdraw combat forces from the country. “The attacks have shattered the confidence of ordinary Afghans, who are increasingly blaming the government for failing to prevent them,” one expert said.

Kabul’s police chief, General Zahir Zahir, said: “It is possible for a few people to sneak in without the authorities noticing. Such an incident can happen anywhere. These attacks are sophisticated. The military-grade explosives often used in such attacks is issued to the Pakistan army,” he said.

“My thoughts are with our injured colleague, and with the families and friends of those killed,” said the British ambassador in Kabul, Sir Richard Stagg.

“I am deeply saddened to confirm that a British national civilian security team member and an Afghan national working for the embassy were killed in the incident,” the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said in a statement.

“Next of kin have been informed,” a spokesman for G4S said. “Our thoughts and most heartfelt condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved.”

A second loud explosion was later heard in Kabul’s affluent Wazir Akbar Khan area. Witnesses said Afghan police special forces had surrounded the area and bursts of heavy machine gun fire could be heard.

Local shopkeepers said military forces had traded fire with multiple attackers. “Two or three insurgents have entered the compound. Our forces are there and the fight is ongoing,” the commander of 111 Military Corps Kabul, Qadam Shah Shaheem, told Reuters. Two suicide attackers were said to have been killed by security forces.

The attack took place near the compound of the development agency International Relief and Development, Reuters reported.

The Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayoub Salangi confirmed the target of the attack was a guest house in the diplomatic area. He said no foreigners had been killed. “One of the attackers blew himself up,” Mr Salangi said.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/british-embassy-vehicle-hit-in-suicide-bomb-attack-in-kabul-9886235.html

General Ayoub Salangi, the deputy interior minister, said the bomber was riding a motorcycle on Jalalabad Road during Thursday’s attack.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it “targeted foreign invading forces” and many were killed and wounded.

The British embassy in Kabul confirmed to Al Jazeera that their vehicle was hit in the attack, adding that there were no diplomats in the vehicle, and that a number of its staff were being treated for injuries.

Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kabul, said the Taliban has struck numerous targets along Jalalabad Road in recent weeks.

“The fighters promised to step up attacks after the Afghan president [Ashraf Ghani] gave go ahead for some foreign forces to remain behind and train Afghan troops at the end of the year. It seems they are doing exactly that,” he said.

The explosion could be heard across Kabul and a plume of smoke rose high into the air above the attack site on Jalalabad Road, a main route that houses many foreign compounds and military facilities.

The bombing is the latest in a wave of attacks to hit Kabul as the majority of foreign combat troops withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of the year after 13 years of war against the Taliban and its allies.

Following the attack, Richard Stagg, British ambassador to Afghanistan, vowed to continue extending help to the government in Kabul, and help the country “enjoy peace and security.” 

Fears are growing that Afghanistan could tip into a cycle of violence as the NATO military presence declines, with the national security forces already suffering high battlefield casualties.Ghani, who came to power in September, has pledged to bring peace to Afghanistan after decades of conflict, saying he is open to talks with the Taliban, who ruled Kabul from 1996 to 2001.

Ghani finally emerged as president after signing a power-sharing deal with Abdullah Abdullah, his poll rival.

Both men claimed to have won fraud-tainted elections in a prolonged stand-off that caused political paralysis in Kabul and stoked violence nationwide.

In another development, Britain ended its 13-year military presence in southern Afghanistan this week, when the last Royal Air Force personnel departed left Kandahar airfield.

The British military contribution next year will be the supervision of an officers’ training academy outside Kabul.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2014/11/27/british-embassy-vehicle-hit-in-kabul-attack

BBC News, Kabul","Police in Afghanistan are investigating a shooting at a mosque in Kabul which left 11 people dead.

Four or five gunmen entered the Sufi minority mosque during evening prayers. After initially opening fire, they held each of the victims down and shot them in the head.

Only one man survived the attack, which happened on Saturday, by lying under the bodies while injured.

Violent attacks on mosques in Afghanistan are very rare.

The survivor said the killers shouted ""Kill them all. Do not leave any alive.""

He said the gunmen spoke in Pashto - a language spoken mostly in the south and east of Afghanistan.

Those who died followed a traditional Afghan Sufi strand of Islam which is hated by the Taliban, and also by fundamentalists from other mujahideen groups set up in the 1980s in the war against Russian occupation.

Sufism - or Islamic mysticism - was once suppressed by the Taliban but has returned in recent years.

Violent attacks of this sort on mosques are very rare in Afghanistan. The unspoken fear is that this could be the work of the so-called Islamic State group, which has been attempting to recruit followers in Afghanistan after its successes in Iraq and Syria.The weapons used in the attack were handguns fitted with silencers, and using very small .22 calibre bullets.

About 170 rounds were fired in the attack, suggesting that the gunmen had time to reload at least twice.

The preacher at the mosque, Pir Bahadur Jan Agha, was well known and respected in Afghanistan, and had followers abroad.

He lies buried alongside his son, who died with him, in a freshly dug grave in the courtyard of the mosque.

His 13-year-old grandson Idris made an impromptu speech to mourners, saying: ""Our leader was my grandfather. It was the enemies of Islam who came and killed him while he was praying.""

He was frequently interrupted by cries of ""Allah Takbir"" - God is Great - from a crowd of mourners who included a doctor, engineers, an army officer, and the former head of the provincial council in the northern province of Takhar, Muhammad Ullah.

Idris said there had been attempts on the life of Pir Agha before, including a failed bomb attack on his vehicle.

""We all worried about his security and we said the enemy could ambush Agha sahib any time. Agha sahib had no problem with any other religions, he was a spiritual person,"" he said.

LATIFI-LA Times,"Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan —  Nothing could have prepared Mohammad Zarar for the lead story on Afghanistan’s 10 p.m. television news Saturday.
The Sufi Muslim meetinghouse in Kabul that the 46-year-old science teacher attended for more than a decade was attacked by gunmen. Officials said six people were killed, but members of the Sufi order said Sunday that 11 had died, including the local leader of the order and his son.

“It sent a shock through my whole system,” Zarar said.

Mosques have been attacked before in Afghanistan’s long-running conflict, but this was the first time in memory that a Sufi khanqah, or spiritual center, was the target of deadly violence. The ancient Sufi order, which has millions of followers in Afghanistan and across South Asia, is revered among mainstream Muslims for its mystical practices and nonviolent teachings.

Members of the order said the victims, and another man who was injured, were in the middle of their evening prayers when the gunmen opened fire.

No group has claimed responsibility for the killings, but Zarar said he is certain it was a coordinated attack. Police officials say they have detained five suspects, but details of the attack remain sketchy.

“Only the enemies of Islam could attack a place where people come together in the name of God,” Zarar said.

Zarar and others who spent years studying Islamic philosophy at the Bahadur Agha center were especially disturbed by reports that the firearms were equipped with silencers.

“No ordinary person has access to silencers,” Zarar said.

Afghanistan is regarded as a birthplace of Sufism, and some of the order’s most important figures originated here. Rumi, a 13th century theologian and poet, is believed to have been born in the northern city of Balkh.

When Afghanistan was ruled by the Taliban government in the late 1990s, many Sufis were driven underground or prosecuted. Some Islamic extremists regard the Sufis’ practices, which can include meditating, singing and dancing, as heretical.

In recent years, extremist groups in Libya and Pakistan have destroyed Sufi sites. But Saturday’s slayings were believed to be a first in Afghanistan.

Abdullah Habdi, a member of the Sufi order who spent the night at the hospital where the injured man was being treated, said the man “fainted when he heard the gunshots.”

“No one saw their faces or even how many gunmen there were,” Habdi said.

Like the dozens of men who came to the meetinghouse Sunday to offer their condolences, Habdi said he could not understand the intention of the shooters.

“We welcomed everybody here to honor and praise God in peace,” Habdi said. “We had no enemies.”

Habdi added that the khanqah received students from every ethnic and political group and from far-off northern parts of the country, as well as visitors from the U.S.-led NATO military coalition. When a Swedish female pilot visited once, he said, they welcomed her and offered her a veil.

“How could people who didn’t even turn away unbelievers become targets?” he asked.

""A group of armed men entered (a Sufi mosque)... and opened fire, killing five people and injuring six others,"" Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai told AFP.

The rare attack on Kabul's Sufi minority shattered a relative calm that had descended on the Afghan capital in recent weeks.
Though no group claimed responsibility for the attack in its immediate aftermath, Afghanistan remains plagued by a Taliban insurgency more than 13 years after the militant group was ousted from power.
NATO ended its combat mission in late December, leaving a residual force to carry on a training and support mission to Afghanistan's 350,000 security forces, who now lead the fight against the Taliban.

","The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) affiliates in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for an attack on a religious congregation hall (Takya khana/Hussainiya) in Kabul city.

A statement was released by the terror group which circulated online by the sympathizers of the group claiming responsibility behind the attack.

The statement in Arabic language states that the attack on the religious hall was carried out using four explosive devices.

This was the first attack claimed by the terror group which targets a religious congregation hall where Shi’ite Muslims are gathering.

The group claimed that numerous people were killed or injured in the attack but the security officials said one person was killed and three others including a woman were injured.

Deputy security chief for Kabul security commandment Syed Gul Aqa Rohani told reporters that three magnetic bombs were planted near Chendawol religious hall which went off earlier this afternoon.

This comes as a group of two militants launched an attack on a restaurant in the 3rd police district of Kabul city on Thursday evening.

The two heavily armed militants were shot dead by the security forces as soon as they started firing on the guests which left at least two people dead and three others wounded.

","Two gunmen strapped with suicide bombing explosives were stopped from launching a major terror attack at a Kabul restaurant on Thursday, but they reportedly killed at least two people before they were shot dead by the security forces. 

The militants -- armed with guns, hand grenades and other explosives -- targeted the Kolbah Solh Restaurant in western Kabul on Thursday night. 

As soon as the gunmen opened fire at the Kabul restaurant, they were shot dead by Afghan intelligence operatives, according to Khaama Press.

Fifteen others were wounded in the attack on Le Jardin, an Afghan-owned eatery, which caused a piercingly loud explosion and left a building engulfed in flames.

The attack comes a day after Afghanistan announced four-way talks in Pakistan on January 11, aimed at jump-starting peace negotiations with the resurgent Taliban.

""We can confirm a suicide car bomb attack on Le Jardin,"" Fraidoon Obaidi, the head of Kabul's Criminal Investigation Department, told AFP.

""We are busy extinguishing the fire at the scene... two Afghans have been killed and 15 others wounded,"" he added.

The Italian-run Emergency Hospital in Kabul said on Twitter that the fatalities included a 12-year-old boy who was declared dead on arrival.

Security forces cordoned off the area and firefighters and ambulances were seen rushing to the restaurant, which sports a large garden festooned with rose bushes and is a popular hangout for foreigners and wealthy Afghans.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Twitter claimed several foreigners had been killed and wounded in the suicide attack.

Taliban insurgents routinely exaggerate the death toll in attacks on government and foreign targets.

Friday's bombing evoked memories of an audacious Taliban attack on another restaurant popular with expats, the Taverna du Liban, in January 2014, which left 21 people dead, including 13 foreigners.

Then, desperate customers tried to hide under tables as one attacker detonated his suicide vest at the fortified entrance to the eatery and two other militants stormed inside and opened fire.

Uncertainty over talks

The latest attack comes just days after Pakistan's powerful army chief General Raheel Sharif visited Kabul to try to prepare the ground for fresh peace talks with the resurgent Taliban.

Both sides agreed to hold a first round of dialogue between Afghanistan, Pakistan, US and China on January 11 to lay out a comprehensive roadmap for peace, officials in Kabul said.

Pakistan hosted a milestone first round of talks in July but the negotiations stalled when the insurgents belatedly confirmed the death of longtime leader Mullah Omar.

Afghanistan sees the support of Pakistan as vital to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table.

But despite the growing bonhomie with Islamabad, analysts caution that any substantive talks are still a long way off.

On Monday, just a day after Sharif's visit, a Taliban bomber detonated an explosives-packed vehicle near Kabul airport, killing one civilian in an attack targeting a NATO convoy.

Observers say the intensifying insurgency highlights a push by the Taliban to make more military gains to try to achieve greater concessions during talks.

Afghan forces are currently battling to push back Taliban insurgents who seized large swathes of the key opium-rich district of Sangin in the southern province of Helmand.

The offensive has prompted the first British deployment to the volatile province in 14 months.

The deployment, in addition to a recent arrival of US special forces in the region, comes a year after NATO forces formally ended their combat operations in the country.

The British and US intervention has fuelled the perception that foreign powers are increasingly being drawn back into the conflict as Afghan forces struggle to rein in the Taliban.

JANUARY 1, 20161:47 PMUPDATED 7 YEARS AGO",By Sayed Hassib-Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide attack on a French restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday killed a 12-year-old boy and wounded more than a dozen other people, officials said.


The latest in a series of suicide bombings in Kabul targeted “Le Jardin”, one of a small number of restaurants in the city still frequented by foreigners.

The medical aid group Emergency said 15 people had been referred for treatment to the hospital that it runs nearby, and that a 12-year-old boy had been dead on arrival.

The incident came almost two years after a suicide attack on a Lebanese restaurant in the city killed 21 people, including 13 expatriates, and prompted many foreign organisations to withdraw staff or place tight restrictions on their movements.

In the hours after the explosion, large numbers of police and security force personnel blocked off the site, parts of which were on fire.

During a search of the surrounding areas, one suspect was arrested, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.

Earlier this week, one civilian was killed and 33 were wounded in an attack claimed by the Taliban in an area close to Kabul airport. Last week, six U.S soldiers were killed as they patrolled near Bagram air base outside Kabul and, last month, suicide attackers struck a Spanish embassy guesthouse in the capital.

The attacks have coincided with renewed efforts to revive a peace process with the Taliban that broke down in July after news came out that the movement’s leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, had died two years earlier.

Officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and China are due to meet in Pakistan on Jan. 11 for a meeting aimed at laying the groundwork for talks with the insurgents.

However the Taliban, which is struggling to contain bloody factional fighting over the leadership succession, has so far refused to take part while foreign forces remain in Afghanistan.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who said this week that terrorism had to end for the talks to succeed, condemned the latest attack.

A bomb was detonated at a popular restaurant often frequented by foreigners in the Afghan capital of Kabul.


""The explosion happened in Qala-e-Fathullah neighborhood of Kabul city. Apparently a restaurant has been attacked,"" a spokesman for the interior ministry told AFP news agency.

""Police have cordoned off the area,"" the spokesman added.

Media reports suggest that there may be casualties, although authorities have yet to provide further details on the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.

Meanwhile, the Afghan government is pushing for peace talks with the Taliban militant group, which made surprising gains in 2015.

On January 11, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the US and China are set to begin talks aimed at establishing a comprehensive roadmap for peace, according to officials.

Pakistan, which is said to have political sway over the militant group, held historic talks in July 2015. However, they broke down after the Taliban confirmed the death of their enigmatic leader Mullah Omar.

Friday's attack comes less than a week after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide attack near Kabul's airport that left at least one person dead and 33 others wounded.

Afghan forces are also struggling to contain elements of the ""Islamic State"" militant group, which made inroads into the Asian country in 2015.",https://www.dw.com/en/bomb-blast-rocks-kabul-on-first-day-of-new-year/a-18954303

 — 
ISIS is claiming responsibility for a joint suicide bombing Saturday that killed dozens of people during a peaceful demonstration by a minority group in Kabul, Afghanistan.

“I saw tens of people laying down in blood around me and hundreds of people running away from the scene,” said Fatima Faizi, an Afghan freelance journalist.

So far, 80 bodies and more than 260 wounded people were taken to hospitals in Kabul, according to Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry.

Sayed Hamed, 30, attended the protest but left before the explosions. He was about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away.

“As I was watching (from my hotel) and some (people) were running toward the scene and some were crying coming from the scene,” he wrote in an email to CNN. “It was a very sad situation, and everyone was trying to find their relatives or friends.”

The attack, the worst in months in terms of casualties, drew attention to ISIS instead of the Taliban, which had been blamed for recent bombings.Two ISIS fighters detonated their suicide belts among the protesters, according to ISIS’ media wing, Amaq. A third attacker was killed by security forces before detonating his bomb, according to an Afghan security official speaking on condition of anonymity.
The White House condemned the “horrific attack,” adding that it was made “all the more despicable by the fact that it targeted a peaceful demonstration.”

The UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office echoed the sentiment. FCO Minister Alok Sharma said “the UK remains steadfast and resolute in our long-term commitment to the Afghan people. We will continue to work with the Government of Afghanistan to help build a more stable and secure Afghanistan.”

In a separate incident Sunday, a rocket landed in a kindergarten yard in the Macroryan district of Kabul, Sediq Sediqqi, Afghanistan Interior Ministry spokesman told CNN. Even though no casualties were reported, Afghanistan remained on high alert Sunday, Sediqqi said.The jihadist terrorist group has been stepping up attacks worldwide – and most recently in Afghanistan – while losing territory in its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq and Syria.

The blast in Kabul on Saturday afternoon happened during a demonstration by members of the Hazara, a Shiite minority group, near the Afghan Parliament building and Kabul University. Declaring a national day of mourning Saturday evening, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani ordered flags in the nation to be flown at half-staff.The protesters were demanding a planned power line be rerouted through their poverty-stricken Bamyan province to ensure electricity in the relatively isolated area west of Kabul.

Accounting for up to one-fifth of Afghanistan’s population, Hazaras, a Persian-speaking people who mainly live in central Afghanistan, have long been branded outsiders for their Shia faith and far Asian features in the country dominated by followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, according to a 2008 National Georgraphic article.

The Hazara in the past have demanded the government protect them from attacks blamed on the Sunni Taliban and ISIS.

On November 11, thousands of protesters marched through Kabul with coffins containing the decapitated bodies of seven Hazaras, four men, two women and one child. The protesters called for justice for the beheadings, chanting slogans seeking death for the Taliban and ISIS.

Saturday’s attack is the latest in a rash of kidnappings and bombings in Kabul, which have heightened security fears in the nation’s capital.

The Taliban have claimed responsibility for other attacks.

Three weeks ago, two Taliban suicide bombers killed 34 people when they attacked a convoy of buses carrying newly graduated police officers in Kabul.

On June 20 in the Afghan capital, a suicide bomber killed 14 Nepali security contractors who worked for the Canadian embassy.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack in a text message sent to media organizations.

According to a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, 231 people were wounded, though this figure could rise.

The attack, the deadliest in Kabul since 2001, has raised fears of an intensification in sectarian conflict. Since Afghanistan’s civil war in the 1990s the country has largely been spared the sectarian violence that plagues neighbouring Pakistan, as well as Iraq and Syria, where Isis has deliberately tried to stoke ethnic tensions.


Hazaras have historically suffered discrimination and persecution. The protesters were marching against government plans for a major power project to bypass Bamiyan, a predominantly Hazara province in the central highlands. Following similar protests in May, Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, established a commission to look into the issue but government attempts to find a compromise failed. On 19 June, a contract was signed to build a smaller electricity line through Bamiyan, which did not placate Hazara activists.

In the hours after the attack, details of casualties were unclear, but some security forces seemed to have been among the killed. As people were frantically calling friends present at the protests, calls went out on social media for blood donations to the city’s poorly resourced hospitals. “I was standing by the side of the crowd, behind an ice cream truck,” said one protester, Aman Turkmani. When the blast happened, “first the ice cream cart exploded, then he exploded. The sound of the explosion was very strong,” he said.

Hours after the attack on Saturday, Amaq said Isis had sent two fighters with suicide belts to detonate among “a Shia gathering”. If confirmed, the attack would be the group’s first against civilians in the Afghan capital. Kabul has become increasingly unnerved, particularly after another massive attack in April, which also killed 64 people. That attack was the deadliest in the capital since 2011.

Isis has so far been concentrated in a few districts in Afghanistan’s eastern provinces, where they have battled for turf with the Taliban. Their fighting force of 2,000-3,000 fighters is relatively small, but Saturday’s attack is likely to stoke fears that Isis is gaining strength in the country. Most Afghans consider Isis to be an alien, extremist group, that is far more radical than the Taliban.


Ghani said in a statement: “Opportunist terrorists went among the protesters and set off explosions that killed and wounded a number of our countrymen, including security and defence personnel.” Leading Hazara representatives in the government had refused to endorse the protesters, accusing them of fuelling ethnic tension. Instead, the demonstration was led by grassroots activists and Karim Khalili, the country’s former vice-president.

According to a western official, the head of Afghanistan’s intelligence service had earlier this week tried to persuade the protesters to cancel the event. The government deployed minimal security personnel to protect protesters, focusing instead on keeping them away from the city centre. At a previous demonstration, in late 2015, protesters who attempted to scale the wall of the presidential palace were shot at.

On Saturday, to keep the demonstration away from the palace, authorities blocked central roads, forcing protesters to gather at Deh Mazang Square, about two miles from the palace. To Hazaras, the power project is about more than electricity. A Shia minority making up an estimated 9% of the Afghan population, Hazaras have historically felt discriminated by the government and persecuted by insurgents.

The worst recent attack on Shias was in 2011 when twin blasts in Kabul and Mazar-i Sharif killed as many as 80 worshipers, most of them Hazaras who had gathered to commemorate the holy Shia day of Ashura. Hazaras have also been targeted in highway kidnappings, some of which have ended in killings of hostages. In 2015, seven relatives were kidnapped and beheaded by Islamists in Zabul province, sparking protests outside the presidential palace in demand for better protection of Hazaras.

Many Afghan migrants and refugees who travel to Europe are Hazaras who argue for asylum on grounds of persecution. Bamiyan and Kabul, where Saturday’s attack took place, are two out of three provinces, which the UK government deem safe enough to deport Afghans to.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/hazara-minority-targeted-by-suicide-bombs-at-kabul-protest

If verified, the claim from the Islamic State-affiliated Amaq News Agency would represent an ominous widening of the group’s reach, which up until now had been mainly confined to a province bordering Pakistan. The Taliban issued a statement saying it was not involved.

The attack, among the most lethal since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, drew condemnation from the Obama administration, the United Nations mission in Afghanistan and the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in the country.

President Ashraf Ghani, in a televised address, declared a day of mourning on Sunday. He vowed to seek revenge on those responsible, saying in a statement that “peaceful protest is the right of every citizen.”

The Hazara community is mainly made up of Shiite Muslims, considered apostates by the Sunni Muslim extremists of Islamic State.

The demonstrators who gathered Saturday were renewing calls for a major electricity line to be routed through Bamiyan province, the Hazara heartland, in order to generate jobs and revenue.

Thousands marched through the streets of Kabul, carrying banners decrying discrimination against Hazaras and waving Afghan flags. The protesters had just started setting up tents in Kabul’s Deh Mazang Square when an explosion ripped through the crowd.

According to an Interior Ministry statement cited by local news reports, three suicide bombers targeted the rally. One failed to successfully detonate his explosives, and another was shot dead by security forces before he could do so.

Images circulating on social media showed dozens of bodies and debris strewn across the area and people running frantically to escape.

The terror attacks you haven’t heard about »

Roadblocks set up to keep the protesters away from the presidential palace and other sensitive sites got in the way of ambulances that were attempting to reach the square, delaying the transfer of some of the injured to the hospital, witnesses said.

Kabul residents turned to Facebook to organize blood drives, posting updates about which hospitals were in need of donations.

Islamic State has been active in Afghanistan since 2014 and is estimated to have between 2,000 and 3,000 fighters there, many of them disaffected members of the Taliban and Pakistani insurgent groups.

Although the group has claimed responsibility for horrific attacks before, many of them directed against rival Taliban forces, it has until now largely confined its operations to parts of Nangarhar province.

This would mark the militants’ first attack in the Afghan capital. The fear is that it could further inflame sectarian divisions and fuel discontent with the country’s unity government.

“This incident is an outrage that cannot be justified,” United Nations envoy Tadamichi Yamamoto said, calling it a war crime. “It is an attempt to spread terror amongst civilians and stifle the freedoms that Afghans have sacrificed so much to obtain.”

The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Gen. John Nicholson, also denounced the attack, saying international forces “remain firmly committed to supporting our Afghan partners and the national unity government.”

In Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby said, “The killers responsible for this bloodshed do not represent the future for Afghanistan and will not prevail.”

He said the Obama administration had offered assistance to the Afghan government in its investigation of the attack and prosecution of the culprits.",https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-kabul-blast-20160723-snap-story.html

Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, says the group’s Amaq News Agency.

Photographs posted on social media showed bodies, apparently at the site of the explosion, close to where thousands of people had been protesting over the route of a planned multi-million dollar power line.


Thousands of people from Afghanistan’s Hazara minority had gathered to demand changes to the route of a planned multi-million dollar power transmission line.

The demonstrators were demanding the 500 kV transmission line from Turkmenistan to Kabul be rerouted through two provinces with large Hazara populations, an option the government says would cost millions and delay the badly needed project by years.

Much of the city centre was sealed off with stacks of shipping containers and other obstacles and security was tight with helicopters patrolling overhead but there was no violence by the protestors until the blast rocked the city.

The Persian-speaking Hazara, estimated to make up about 9 percent of the population, are Afghanistan’s third largest minority but they have long suffered discrimination. Thousands were killed during Taliban rule. However, they are politically well organised and several of their leaders are in President Ashraf Ghani’s delicately balanced national unity government, which has added to the sensitivity surrounding the demonstration.

The Associated Press","KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Afghanistan marked a national day of mourning on Sunday, a day after a suicide bomber killed at least 80 people who were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in Kabul. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State group.

Authorities say another 231 people were wounded, some seriously, in the bombing Saturday afternoon on a march by members of the ethnic Hazara community, who are predominantly Shiite Muslim. Most Afghans are Sunni, and the IS group regards Shiites as apostates.

The attack was the first by IS on Kabul — and the capital’s worst since a vicious Taliban insurgency began 15 years ago — raising concerns about the group’s reach and capability in Afghanistan.

Bereaved families collected their dead from hospitals and morgues across the capital, and began digging graves as the first funerals went ahead in the west of the capital.

Many people chose to bury their dead together with others — rather than in traditional family plots — encouraged by organizers of the Saturday demonstration, who call themselves the Enlighten Movement. In a hilltop graveyard in the Surkh Abad suburb of south-western Kabul, hundreds of people, most of them men, braved high winds and swirling dust to conduct the Shiite funeral rites.

Simple wooden coffins covered in the green Shiite flag were carried by men on their shoulders and lowered into graves that relatives had dug themselves with shovels.

In the city’s west, in Omaid-a-Sabz, the grieving chose to bury their dead side by side in long rows. Mullah Mohammad Hassan Rasat said the Hazara people felt a deep sense of injustice and anger that the government had not kept its election promise to ensure that development was equal for all Afghan ethnic groups.

“Our people only want justice and equal development for all,” he said.

Hazaras account for up to 15 percent of Afghanistan’s population, estimated at around 30 million, and say they face discrimination. During the Taliban’s 1996-2001 rule, the Hazaras were often brutally treated. The Taliban were quick to deny culpability for the Saturday attack, however, issuing a statement before IS claimed responsibility.

The Saturday attack has raised concerns about sectarianism, and the Interior Ministry announced a ban on public gatherings and demonstrations in an apparent bid to avoid any inter-communal strife. A presidential spokesman pointed out that the ban on public gatherings would not apply to the funerals for Saturday’s victims.

IS has had a presence in Afghanistan for the past year, mainly in the eastern province of Nangarhar along the Pakistani border. The Afghan military, backed by U.S. troops, is planning an offensive against IS positions in Nangarhar in coming days.

Prior to the Saturday attack, thousands of Hazaras had marched through Kabul to demand the rerouting of a power line through their impoverished province of Bamiyan, in the central highlands. It was their second demonstration; the first was in May with a much better turnout and attended by senior Hazara politicians, who were absent from Saturday’s march.

The office of President Ashraf Ghani said that march organizers had been warned to call off the demonstration after intelligence was received that an attack was likely.

Daud Naji, an Enlighten Movement leader, said on Sunday that they had been told only that there was a “heightened risk” of attack and had subsequently cancelled nine of 10 planned routes.

On Sunday, Ghani attended a memorial prayer service in a mosque on the grounds of the presidential palace, his spokesman Haroon Chakhansuri said.

The office of the United Nations assistance mission in Afghanistan issued a statement conveying its “deepest condolences and solidarity” and noting that people of all ethnicities across the country were still queueing at hospitals to donate blood for the wounded.

Hazara demonstrators have continued to occupy Demazang Square, where the attack took place as the march was winding down and some prepared to set up a camp, Naji said. They would stay until three conditions were met, he said.

The Enlighten Movement wished to have its own representatives, as well as others from international human rights organizations, involved in a commission Ghani has established to investigate the IS attack.

The movement also wanted the power line rerouted through Bamiyan, as originally demanded. The multi-million-dollar regional project was routed away from Bamiyan by the previous Afghan government for financial considerations, according to people involved in the planning, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.

Thirdly, Naji said, they wanted the name of Demazang Square changed to Shahada or Martyrs’ Square, “to honor the memories of those who were killed, along with a picture of everyone who died there.”

Ghani’s spokesman Chakhansuri confirmed that the president has issued a decree to change the name of the square as the Hazaras had asked. He also said that Enlighten Movement members would participate in the investigation commission.

In response to the rerouting demand for the so-called TUTAP power project, Chakhansuri referred to a contract signed on June 21 for the transmission of a 300-megawatt power line from the north into Bamiyan. Like the TUTAP line, it is also funded by the Asian Development Bank.

The death toll in Saturday’s attack was not yet finalized Sunday, according to the Interior Ministry. The ministry said on Saturday that 80 people were killed; Naji said the Enlighten Movement puts the death toll so far at 84.",https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/afghanistan-marks-day-of-national-mourning-after-huge-attack/

Some families plan to buy their dead in Kabul, while others have chosen to hold funerals in their respective hometowns. Several families are still searching for missing relatives in hospitals and morgues.

Ali Bakhtiyari is set to bury five of his friends, who were killed in Saturday’s blasts.

Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry has issued a ban on public gatherings of all types for the next 10 days.

Thousands of members of the Hazara minority took to the streets of Kabul on Saturday over a new power line, saying its route bypasses provinces where many of them live.

“Two fighters from Islamic State detonated explosive belts at a gathering of Shi’ites in… the city of Kabul in Afghanistan,” Amaq, an ISIL-linked website, said.

Officials in Afghanistan‘s main intelligence agency, the National Directorate for Security (NDS), said the attack was planned by an individual named Abu Ali, an ISIL fighters they said was based in Achin district in Nangarhar.

They said three bombers were involved in the attack.

Ambulances struggled to reach the scene, as authorities had overnight blocked key intersections with stacked shipping containers to control the movement of the protesters.

“I was in the crowd just a few meters away from the blast, it was so loud that I am still in a state of shock,” Mehdi Ali, a protester told Al Jazeera on Sunday.

“I saw dead bodies lying all over the area. Is this the value of human blood here?”

Another protester who is mourning the death of his friend killed in the blasts told Al Jazeera that they have ‘lost hope in the government’ and will ‘not be able to recover from the shock’. 

“We were peaceful protesters asking for our rights, who did we harm? Why did I lose my friend? Did he deserve this?” Zafar, a protester, told Al Jazeera.

“We are shaken.”

Al Jazeera’s Qais Azimy, reporting from Kabul, said it was one of the deadliest attacks in the capital in years.

“The city of Kabul is totally in a shock right now,” he said.

“In the past ISIL has carried out attacks in the eastern part of the country, mainly suicide attacks, but not as far as Kabul – they were limited to Nangarhar province along the border with Pakistan,” Azimy added. 

“If it is true that ISIL is behind this attack it shows the growing capability of the group.”

The Taliban denied any involvement and said in a statement sent to Al Jazeera that the attack was “a plot to ignite civil war”.

The Persian-speaking Hazara, estimated to make up about 9 percent of the population, are Afghanistan‘s third-largest minority, but they have long suffered discrimination and thousands were killed during the period of Taliban rule.

The 500-kilovolt TUTAP power line, which would connect the Central Asian nations of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan with electricity-hungry Afghanistan and Pakistan, was originally set to pass through the central province.

But the government re-routed it through the mountainous Salang pass north of Kabul, saying the shorter route would speed up the project and save millions of dollars.

It was not immediately clear how many bombs were involved in the attack.

Emergency vehicles were at the site and wounded were being carried away.

Much of the city centre had been sealed off with stacks of shipping containers and other obstacles as the march began earlier on Saturday, and security was tight with helicopters patrolling overhead.

Islamic State, also known as Isis, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group’s Amaq news agency reported.

“Two fighters from Islamic State detonated explosive belts at a gathering of Shi’ites in... the city of Kabul in Afghanistan,” Amaq said in a brief news alert.

If the claim is true it would be the first attack by the extremists in the Afghan capital.

The incident came some three weeks after a suicide bomber killed dozens of people in an attack on newly graduated police cadets that was claimed by the Taliban.

The Taliban has denied responsibility for Saturday’s attack.

“Opportunist terrorists went among the protesters and set off explosions that killed and wounded a number of our countrymen including security and defence personnel,” president Ashraf Ghani said in a statement.

Warned organisers
A spokesman for Mr Ghani said the central government shared intelligence with the organisers of the march, warning that they faced a possible “terrorist attack.”

Haroon Chakhansuri revealed government officials warned the march organisers that they risked attack, saying: “We knew that terrorists wanted to bring sectarianism to Kabul, and cause splits within our community.”

He said the president will meet leaders of the Hazara demonstrators later.

Saturday’s demonstrators had been demanding the 500kV transmission line from Turkmenistan to Kabul be rerouted through two provinces with large Hazara populations, an option the government says would cost millions and delay the badly needed project by years.

Amnesty International issued a statement saying the “horrific attack” on the Hazara demonstration “demonstrates the utter disregard that armed groups have for human life”.

The Persian-speaking Hazara, a mainly Shia group estimated to make up about 9 per cent of the population, are Afghanistan’s third-largest minority but they have long suffered discrimination. Thousands were killed under Taliban rule.

The protest by a group whose leaders include members of the national unity government had put pressure on Mr Ghani, who has faced growing opposition from both inside and outside the government.

Russian president Vladimir Putin sent a message to Mr Ghani expressing readiness to fight all forms of terrorism together in the most active way, Russian media cited the Kremlin as saying.

“The head of the Russian state strongly condemned this cynical crime committed against peaceful citizens and reiterated readiness to continue the most active co-operation with the authorities and people of Afghanistan in fighting all forms of terrorism,” Russian media quoted a Kremlin statement as saying.


The White House condemned said: “This heinous attack was made all the more despicable by the fact that it targeted a peaceful demonstration.

Colin Dwyer-NPR","Just two days after a car bomb tore through Kabul, killing at least 90 people and injuring hundreds more, demonstrators took to the streets of the Afghan capital in droves to demand the resignation of top officials. But even as the demonstrations called for better security from extremist violence, further violence arose Friday as security forces opened fire on the protesters.

Kabul Truck Bomb Kills At Least 80 People, Injures Hundreds More
Several demonstrators died in the ensuing chaos. News reports cited Afghan officials who provided varying death tolls, ranging from two to eight people killed.

As Jennifer Glasse reports for our Newscast unit:

""Hospital officials say some of the dead protesters had been shot in the head and the chest.

""One of those killed was the son of an Afghan senator. His body, wrapped in a bloody sheet was briefly carried through the streets.

""Afghanistan's deputy interior minister, Murad Ali Murad, says some of the protesters were carrying weapons, and that police fired in self-defense. He said Afghan security forces were wounded, as well.""

The protesters had been marching toward the presidential palace, demanding the ouster of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. The situation came to a head as many of them charged riot police, some throwing stones, according to The Associated Press, and police loosed a barrage of bullets in addition to tear gas and water cannons.


Police forces struggle against protesters during a demonstration Friday in Kabul, Afghanistan. President Ashraf Ghani denounced the violence as partly caused by ""those who want to agitate and hurt public order.""
Massoud Hossaini/AP
After the protests began, The New York Times reports, Ghani released a statement calling for peace but also blaming ""those who want to agitate and hurt public order, their issue is separate — they will not be allowed to use the people's emotions against the people's interest.""

The demonstration had been prompted by the massive truck bomb Wednesday, which blew through morning rush hour traffic close to the German Embassy. At the time, Glasse reported that explosion was so huge, even ""a mile away there was first a low rumble like an earthquake, then the shock wave from the blast followed and blew open doors and windows.""

""Closer to the explosion it shattered glass in homes, offices and cars,"" she added.

In addition to the dozens who died, more than 450 people were wounded in Wednesday's attack.

""Our brothers and sisters were martyred in the bloody attack on Wednesday,"" one protester told Agence France-Presse on Friday, ""and our leaders are doing nothing to stop this carnage.""",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/02/531234154/protesters-killed-during-demonstration-over-massive-bomb-attack-in-kabul

Haroon Chakhansuri revealed government officials warned the march organisers that they risked attack, saying: “We knew that terrorists wanted to bring sectarianism to Kabul, and cause splits within our community.”

He said the president will meet leaders of the Hazara demonstrators later.

Saturday’s demonstrators had been demanding the 500kV transmission line from Turkmenistan to Kabul be rerouted through two provinces with large Hazara populations, an option the government says would cost millions and delay the badly needed project by years.

Amnesty International issued a statement saying the “horrific attack” on the Hazara demonstration “demonstrates the utter disregard that armed groups have for human life”.

The Persian-speaking Hazara, a mainly Shia group estimated to make up about 9 per cent of the population, are Afghanistan’s third-largest minority but they have long suffered discrimination. Thousands were killed under Taliban rule.

The protest by a group whose leaders include members of the national unity government had put pressure on Mr Ghani, who has faced growing opposition from both inside and outside the government.

Russian president Vladimir Putin sent a message to Mr Ghani expressing readiness to fight all forms of terrorism together in the most active way, Russian media cited the Kremlin as saying.

“The head of the Russian state strongly condemned this cynical crime committed against peaceful citizens and reiterated readiness to continue the most active co-operation with the authorities and people of Afghanistan in fighting all forms of terrorism,” Russian media quoted a Kremlin statement as saying.


The White House condemned said: “This heinous attack was made all the more despicable by the fact that it targeted a peaceful demonstration.

“We remain committed to work jointly with the Afghan security forces and countries in the region to confront the forces that threaten Afghanistan’s security, stability, and prosperity.”",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/at-least-80-killed-in-suicide-bombing-at-kabul-protest-1.2732708

A suicide bomb attack on a hotel compound in Afghanistan's capital ended Monday with the deaths of one policeman and all three attackers.
Kabul's police chief General Abdul Rahman Rahimi said one suicide bomber died when he blew up his explosives-laden truck Monday morning outside the security wall of the Northgate Hotel, just east of the Kabul airport. 
The Northgate houses foreign contractors, including Americans.











Police say the explosion was felt throughout Kabul and knocked out power across much of the city. 








An Afghan policeman guards on a road leading to the site of an explosion, in Kabul, Afghanistan, Monday, Aug. 1, 2016.




Rahimi said two other attackers tried to enter the hotel, but police fired on them, forcing them to take shelter in a nearby compound. The attackers were killed in an ensuing battle that lasted for several hours. One police officer was killed and three others wounded in the exchange of fire.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Taliban failed to enter Northgate, a facility providing life-support services to foreign military personnel in the Afghan capital.

TOLO News, Afghanistan’s first 24-hour broadcaster, said all staff and guests at the hotel were accounted for and unharmed.


It said the attack and ensuing operation was over and that three Taliban fighters were killed. One died in the explosion and two others were shot dead.

Tremors from the massive truck bombing, which was preceded by a power outage, were felt across the city.

Regular and special police units started clearing operations at dawn and killed both the remaining attackers.

“No harm or casualties were inflicted to national or foreign residents within Northgate,” Rahimi said, but added that police were still investigating whether any civilians had been injured by the blast.

A statement from the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said had caused “dozens of casualties”, and added its fighters had entered the compound.

Northgate, close to the US-run Bagram air base north of Kabul, is a heavily guarded compound with blast walls and watchtowers.

Foreign guesthouses have been a regular target of insurgent attacks since the Taliban began their war to topple the Kabul government. 

The attack comes after twin bombings left 80 people dead in the Afghan capital on July 23, in the deadliest attack in the city since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001.

After the attack, Afghan security forces closed off streets around the site, which is east of Kabul’s main international airport and on the way to the sprawling Bagram air base north of the capital.

KABUL, AfghanistanÂ â€”Â Reuters



","
A Taliban suicide attack on a busy area near the defense ministry in the Afghan capital Kabul on Monday killed at least 24 people and wounded 91, less than two weeks after a deadly attack on the cityâ€™s American University.The death toll was confirmed by a spokesman for the public health ministry. The toll might rise further, the spokesman, Mohammad Ismail Kawousi, added. 

Defense ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said there had been two blasts in quick succession in a crowded area of the city near government buildings as well as a market and a main intersection.Army and police personnel as well as civilians rushing to help victims of the first blast were caught in the second explosion, triggered when a suicide bomber blew himself up.The Taliban, who have stepped up their campaign against the Western-backed government in recent weeks, following a brief lull after the death of their former leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, claimed responsibility for the attack.President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, which came less than two weeks after gunmen attacked the American University in Kabul, killing 13 people.Government officials have been preparing for a conference in Brussels next month at which foreign donors, concerned about the ability of the Afghan security forces to withstand Taliban violence, are expected to pledge continuing support over coming years.

The twin bombings killed at least 24
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for twin bombings that killed at least 24, including senior security officials, and wounded 91 in Kabul on Monday.

Defence ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh told Reuters that the blasts hit a busy city area near a market, government buildings and a main intersection. The bombings happened in rapid succession, where civilians, troops and police officers helping victims in the first blast were caught in the second explosion triggered by a suicide bomber.

Among the dead is an army general. It comes less than two weeks after Taliban gunmen attacked the American University in the capital.

According to Reuters, the militants have stepped-up their attacks against the local government following a brief lull after a U.S. drone strike killed their former leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour in May.

In a statement seen by CNN, Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani expressed his condolences to the victims’ families and condemned the acts of violence. “The enemies of Afghanistan have lost their ability to fight the security and defence forces of the country and thus attack highways, cities, mosques, schools and common people.”",https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/taliban-attack-kills-dozens-kabul-164630268.html

","Twin bomb blasts in the Afghan capital Kabul have killed at least 24 people and injured 91 others near the defence ministry, officials say.

The first bomb was detonated remotely while the second was triggered by a suicide bomber, local media reported.

An army general and two senior police officers are among the dead, a ministry of defence spokesperson told the BBC.

The Taliban, who have carried out frequent attacks in Kabul, claimed the blasts.

Deputy defence ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish told the Associated Press news agency that the suicide attacker struck as security forces gathered near the ministry to deal with the first blast.

As night fell, another loud explosion was heard in Kabul, followed by gunfire. There was no immediate word on the cause of the blast or details of any casualties.Civilians, police and soldiers were all killed in the earlier blasts as ministry employees were leaving work at rush hour.

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack saying it had been carried out by ""the enemies of Afghanistan who have lost their ability to fight the security and defence forces"".

He said that ""the aim of the terrorists is to spread fear"".

An Italian-run emergency hospital in Kabul tweeted that it was treating 21 injured people, four of whom died on arrival.In August two foreign professors, one from the US and one from Australia, were kidnapped by armed men near the university.

No group has admitted responsibility and their whereabouts are still unknown. Several other foreigners have been kidnapped in recent times.

In July a suicide bomber from the self-styled Islamic State (IS) targeted a protest march by members of the Shia Hazara minority in Kabul, killing 80 people. Shia Muslims are reviled by IS.

The upsurge in violence in the capital comes as the Taliban also strives to increase its presence nationally, making an already uncertain security situation even worse since Nato forces ended their combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of 2014.

The militants are now threatening to capture Lashkar Gah, the capital of the southern province of Helmand, in addition to the northern city of Kunduz - which they briefly captured last year in their biggest military offensive since the US-led 2001 invasion.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37278556

","An explosion has hit the Afghan capital, just hours after twin blasts killed at least 24 people.

It is understood a suicide car bomber targeted a residential neighbourhood of Kabul home to many foreigners and diplomats in the latest blast.Authorities said gunfire could be heard after but it was not clear if there were any casualties.

As yet there has not been any claim of responsibility.

Earlier, the twin explosions in quick succession tore through a crowded area of the city close to the defence ministry.As well as the 24 people killed, another 90 people were injured.

A suicide bomber caught security forces personnel and civilians who had rushed to help the victims of the first explosion.
An army general and two senior police commanders were among the dead, a defence ministry official said.

The interior ministry initially said the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers on foot.

But officials later said the first bomb was detonated remotely while the second was triggered by a suicide bomber.

Defence ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said: ""The first explosion occurred on a bridge near the defence ministry. 

""The second struck just as soldiers, policemen and civilians hurried to help the victims.""
The assault was apparently aimed at inflicting mass casualties as officials left the ministry after work.

President Ashraf Ghani strongly condemned the bombings and offered condolences to the families of the victims.

""The enemies of Afghanistan have lost their ability to fight the security and defence forces of the country,"" he said.

""That is why they are attacking highways, cities, mosques, schools and common people.""

The militants have stepped up their campaign against the Western-backed government in recent weeks.

The attacks came less than two weeks after gunmen stormed the American University in Kabul, killing 16 people in a nearly 10-hour raid.

The attack on the campus came just weeks after two university professors, an American and an Australian, were kidnapped at gunpoint near the school.

Their whereabouts are still unknown and no group so far has publicly claimed responsibility for the abductions.",https://news.sky.com/story/explosions-in-afghan-capital-kabul-kill-at-least-24-10566690

KABUL, AfghanistanÂ â€”Â Reuters



","
A Taliban suicide attack on a busy area near the defense ministry in the Afghan capital Kabul on Monday killed at least 24 people and wounded 91, less than two weeks after a deadly attack on the cityâ€™s American University.The death toll was confirmed by a spokesman for the public health ministry. The toll might rise further, the spokesman, Mohammad Ismail Kawousi, added. 

Defense ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said there had been two blasts in quick succession in a crowded area of the city near government buildings as well as a market and a main intersection.Army and police personnel as well as civilians rushing to help victims of the first blast were caught in the second explosion, triggered when a suicide bomber blew himself up.The Taliban, who have stepped up their campaign against the Western-backed government in recent weeks, following a brief lull after the death of their former leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, claimed responsibility for the attack.President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, which came less than two weeks after gunmen attacked the American University in Kabul, killing 13 people.Government officials have been preparing for a conference in Brussels next month at which foreign donors, concerned about the ability of the Afghan security forces to withstand Taliban violence, are expected to pledge continuing support over coming years.

","BBC


","At least 14 people have been killed in an attack on a shrine in the Afghan capital, Kabul as Shia Muslims prepared for a religious day of mourning.

A crowd had gathered at the Karte Sakhi shrine for Ashura, a commemoration of the martyrdom of Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.

No group has claimed responsibility.

Meanwhile, hundreds of Afghan troops have been deployed to drive Taliban fighters from the capital of Helmand province, Lashkar Gah, in the south.

Militants have been pushed back to the outskirts of Lashkar Gah, a strategically important city, local officials told the BBC.

Lashkar Gah is reportedly in lock down with only a few shops open and many families trying to flee the fighting.

Schools and universities across Helmand have been closed indefinitely.

The new assault is the Taliban's most concerted push yet into the city.The attack in Kabul happened in one of the city's largest shrines.

One of the dead was a police officer, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior said.

Sediq Sediqqi said police special forces who responded to the scene found and killed only one gunman. Initial reports said three attackers were involved.

An eyewitness said the attacker was dressed in a police uniform.

The death of Hussein, which is commemorated during Ashura, was an event that led to the split in Islam into two main sects - Sunni and Shia Muslims.The government had warned of possible attacks during the day.

An attack in July, claimed by so-called Islamic State, killed 80 people, but before then Afghanistan had not seen the same level of violence against Shia Muslims as neighbouring Pakistan.

Shia Muslims make up about 15% of Afghanistan's population, and many of them come from the Hazara ethnic group.

","Gunmen have killed at least 14 people in a Shia shrine in Kabul, compounding fears that militants are trying to stoke ethnic tensions in the escalating Afghanistan conflict.

The attack took place on the eve of Ashura, one of of the holiest days of the year for Shia Muslims, who constitute a sizeable minority in the country.

As hundreds of worshipers gathered in Kabul’s large Sakhi shrine on Tuesday evening, assailants in police uniforms stormed the complex, according to witnesses who also heard explosions.

A ministry of interior spokesman told Associated Press that 13 civilians and one policeman had been killed. Over 40 were wounded, said the ministry of public health, including at least 15 women. After more than two hours, elite forces killed the last attacker.


“There were women, children and young men praying inside the shrine,” said Shari, 48, a pilgrim.

The area outside the shrine houses a large cemetery and is a favoured picnic spot for Kabul families but is also open landscape with limited security.

Farad Alamdar, who had come to the shrine several days in a row, said: “In previous days, there was a lot of security. I don’t know why there was not much security today. They didn’t even check cars. I talked about that with my cousins over dinner, that attackers could come from everywhere.”

On Ashura, Shias commemorate the death in 680 AD of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, who they regard as a rightful heir to the prophet.

Tuesday’s attack marks the second time in months that Kabul’s Shia community has been targeted. In July,  by members of the Hazara ethnic minority in an attack that was claimed by Islamic State.

In another attack during Ashura in 2011, a suicide bomber  outside another shrine in central Kabul.

Despite these deadly attacks, Afghanistan has largely been spared sectarian violence since 2001.

Tuesday’s attack could be an attempt to stoke ethnic tensions in a country that since the fall of the Taliban 2001 has experienced growing religious freedom and tolerance.

A member of the Afghan intelligence services told the Guardian that security forces feared more attacks were planned against mosques and crowds during the Ashura commemorations.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/afghanistan-gunmen-kill-fourteen-people-shia-shrine-ashura-kabul

","KABUL, AFGHANISTAN — 
Gunmen, reportedly wearing Afghan police uniforms, stormed a packed shrine for Shi’ite Muslims in Kabul late Tuesday and opened fire, killing at least 14 people and wounding more than 30 others.

Officials and witnesses said a suicide bomber blew himself up as the assault began in the Kart-e-Sakhi area of the capital city, while two others were shot and killed by security forces, ending an hours-long siege.

Health officials confirmed at least 16 women were among those wounded and taken to hospitals.

Tuesday was the ninth day of Moharram, the first month on the Muslim calendar.

Shi'ites around the world conduct processions and gather in large groups to mourn the killing of the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad on the ninth and 10th of the month.

Security was particularly tight in Kabul for the annual Shi’ite religious rituals. Afghan authorities, fearing an attack, had requested the community not carry out large street processions but to gather inside their mosques or shrines.

No one has yet claimed responsibility for the deadly assault.

On Wednesday, the Shi’ite community will mark Ashura, the peak of Moharram. Attacks against Shi’ites are not uncommon in Afghanistan. Shi'ites comprise 15 percent of the country’s estimated 30 million people.

Militants, including the Taliban and Islamic State, consider Shi’ites apostates and are blamed for the sectarian violence.",https://www.voanews.com/a/gunman-attack-shiite-shrine-in-kabul/3545755.html

","KABUL (Reuters) - At least 14 people were killed on Tuesday when a gunman in a police uniform opened fire on worshippers gathered at a shrine in the Afghan capital of Kabul for a Shi’ite holy day, officials said.Thirteen civilians and one police officer died and 36 people were wounded, said Ministry of Interior spokesman Sediq Sediqqi.

Ministry of Public Health officials said at least 43 people had been injured in the incident and had been taken to hospitals in the city for treatment.

The attack began just before 8 p.m. (3:30 p.m. GMT), police said, with witnesses reporting an explosion followed by gunfire.

“People were gathered inside the shrine for worshiping when the attackers arrived, first they shot the policemen at the gate of the shrine and then they entered the compound,” said Sardar Hedayat.

Anguished worshippers carried the bodies of dead and wounded people from the iconic building, which is covered in brilliant blue tiles.

Initial reports put the number of attackers at three, but Sediqqi said police special forces who responded to the scene found and killed only one gunman.

The attacker was dressed in a police uniform, said Jamshid Jan, who witnessed the attack.

An angry crowd surrounded and kicked at the suspected attacker’s dead body, with some vowing to burn his remains, before police intervened.

Security forces at the scene evacuated the shrine as the attack unfolded, said Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi.

The attack occurred at one of Kabul’s largest shrines as Shi’ite Muslims gathered to observe the Ashura holy day, which commemorates the 7th Century death of a grandson of the prophet Mohammed.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A Taliban spokesman denied any involvement.

Afghanistan’s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, condemned the shooting and vowed to “hold terrorists (and) their supporters accountable.”

Afghanistan has largely avoided widespread sectarian violence between Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims, but Afghanistan’s Shi’ite minority has complained of discrimination and has faced increased threats.

At least 84 people were killed and another 130 injured in a suicide attack on a Shi’ite demonstration in July. That attack, during a protest march in Kabul, was claimed by Islamic State.

The ""Islamic State"" (IS) also claimed responsibility for the twin attacks in the capital, Kabul, on Tuesday, killing up to 18 people and wounding dozens.

Gunmen entered the Karte Sakhi shrine near Kabul University late on Tuesday, firing at men, women and children as they fleed, witnesses said. The interior ministry said in statement that one of the men was wearing a suicide vest.

Another attacker entered a nearby mosque and took a number of people hostage as they were commemorating Ashura, the ministry said.'Cowardly' atrocity

President Ashraf Ghani condemned as a ""clear sign of a crime against humanity.""

White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the attacks were ""cowardly"" and ""clearly designed to stoke sectarian tension"" in the country. State Department spokesman John Kirby also condemned the violence. The UN called the attack an ""atrocity"" and put the toll at 18, though the interior ministry later said it was 16.

""We commend the government and security forces of Afghanistan for their response to these attacks and their commitment to the peace, security, and prosperity of their country and a future for Afghanistan free of sectarian violence,"" he said.

Sectarian attacks have been relatively rare in Afghanistan, unlike neighboring Pakistan where violence - particularly by Sunni hardliners against the Shiite minority - has claimed thousands of lives over the past decade.

Blast in northern Balkh province comes a day after ISIL gunman killed 18 at Kabul shrine on the holy day of Ashura.",12-Oct-16,SOURCE: NEWS AGENCIES-Aljazeera,"At least 14 Afghan civilians have been killed in a bomb blast outside a mosque in northern Balkh province, a day after a deadly gun attack on Shia worshippers at a shrine in the capital, Kabul.

Munir Ahmad Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor in Balkh, said on Wednesday the attack targeted a group of Shia Muslims following ceremonies commemorating Ashura, a holy day.

He said 36 people were also wounded in the explosion in the provincial capital, Mazar-i-Sharif.

“The death toll could rise because a number of the wounded people are in critical condition,” said Farhad, adding the bomb appeared to have been detonated by remote control.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Wednesday’s blast.

Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility for a similar attack on the Shia community in Kabul on Tuesday.At least 18 people were killed, according to a United Nations tally, by a gunman who entered the Karte Shakhi shrine and opened fire on a crowd of worshippers gathered for Ashura.

ISIL said in a statement on Wednesday that the attacker detonated a suicide vest after firing all his ammunition, but security forces said they shot the man dead.

A Reuters video showed the suspected attacker’s body intact, with no sign of an explosive vest.

One survivor, Saleha, said from her hospital bed that she was sheltering her infant daughter when the gunman came upon them.

“He ran out of bullets and while he was changing his gun’s magazine I begged him, saying my six-month old is innocent, please don’t kill us. He shook his head saying ‘OK, OK’ and went out.”

IN PICTURES – Muslims worldwide mark Ashura

Ashura marks the 7th-century death of a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Hussein.

The day is typically marked by processions that often include self-flagellation by some worshippers. Government warnings of possible attacks prompted a more subdued observation this year.

In Afghanistan, Shia Muslims make up an estimated 15 percent of the population of about 30 million and most are ethnic Hazaras. Groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) view Shias as apostates and frequently attack their mosques and public gatherings.

An ISIL attack on the ethnic minority on July 23 in Kabul killed 84 people and wounded 130 others.

Many more were wounded in the blast at an annual Shia ceremony at the Baqir ul Olum mosque in the west of the city.

The attacker arrived on foot and blew himself up among worshippers inside.

So-called Islamic State (IS) said that it was behind the blast. It is the latest of several recent attacks on Afghanistan's Shia community claimed by the Sunni Muslim militant group.Monday's bombing took place at 12:30 local time (08:00 GMT) during a service to commemorate the death of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Muhammad's grandson and a Shia martyr.

Sunnis and Shia: Islam's ancient schism

Eyewitnesses said the service was almost over when the bomb was detonated.

Police gave the figure of 27 dead, but the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said 32 were killed and more than 50 injured. Some reports suggest a higher number of wounded.

IS said the attack was carried out by an IS ""fighter"" but gave no other details on its self-styled Amaq news agency.

""I was inside the mosque and the Mullah was reading the prayer,"" Ewaz Ali, 50, who suffered minor injuries, told the Associated Press news agency.

""Suddenly a huge explosion happened, then everywhere was dark.""
Afghan security forces keep watch in front of a mosque where an explosion happened in Kabul, Afghanistan Another worshipper, Nadir Ali, told AFP news agency the blast had created a cloud of dust: ""When the dust settled down, I saw the mosque was full of flesh and blood. I was injured in my waist and had to crawl out of the mosque.""

Local reports suggested children were among the dead.

There has not been a proper census for more than 40 years, but it is estimated that around 20% of the Afghan population are Shia Muslims - the rest are Sunni. Most Shia Muslims come from the Tajik and Hazara ethnic minorities.

They have been spared levels of sectarian violence seen in Pakistan and Iraq, but they have been targeted at least three times in recent months:

    In a gun attack on a shrine in Kabul in October in which at least 14 people died 

    In an explosion at a mosque in October in the northern province of Balkh in which at least 14 people died

    In a suicide bomb attack on a Shia protest march in July, which left 80 dead

All three attacks were claimed by IS.

Groups affiliated to IS, present in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar along the Pakistan border, seem intent on fomenting sectarian violence, says the BBC's Harun Najafizada in Kabul.

What is really worrying is that fragile national unity now seems to be targeted, with possibly devastating results if such attacks continue, our correspondent adds. Taliban militants were quick to distance themselves from Monday's attack.

""We condemn this blast,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the BBC. ""This act cannot be our work and has nothing to do with us.""

President Ashraf Ghani called the attack an attempt ""to sow seeds of discord"".

Afghan government Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah urged the country not to fall victim to ""enemy plots that divide us by titles"".

",42695.82361,Noor Zahid-VOA,"WASHINGTON — 
Monday's suicide bombing of a Shiite mosque in Kabul is yet another indicator of Islamic State's expanding terror activities in parts of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, government officials and analysts say.

IS, which claimed responsibility for the bombing, is expanding its presence in several districts of Afghanistan, including eastern Nangarhar province, which borders Pakistan, officials say. And in Pakistan, authorities say recent arrests of IS members in several parts of Pakistan show the group is establishing a foothold in that country.

With IS under siege from a coalition of forces in Iraq and Syria, the terrorist group is looking for safer havens elsewhere, experts say.

“As IS has found itself increasingly on the defensive in the Middle East, it seems to be looking for new areas to carve out a presence,"" said Michael Kugleman, an analyst at the Wilson Center, a global policy research group. “The Afghanistan-Pakistan region, where it already has a light footprint, appears to be one of the targets.”

By targeting Shiite minority members in Afghanistan, IS is trying to create divisions between Shiites and the Sunni majority in Afghanistan, analysts say.

Mosques now military training centers

Last month, IS gunmen stormed Kabul's Kart-e Sakhi shrine and opened fire on Shiite mourners, killing 19 of them.

IS has killed dozens of religious scholars it deems as the enemy or repugnant to its extremist brand of Islam, local Afghan officials told VOA. IS has been reported using mosques as military centers.

“IS has turned at least 60 mosques in five districts of Nangarhar into military training centers,” Abdul Zahir Haqqani, director of religious affairs in Nangarhar, told VOA's Afghan service. The imams have fled to Jalalabad, Nangarhar's capital city, Haqqani added.

IS also has launched multiple attacks on Afghan police checkposts and villages in recent months, it has imposed taxes on agriculture activities in areas it controls, and it has been cutting down trees in some parts of the province in a timber-smuggling operation to neighboring Pakistan.

The governor of southern Zabul province said IS is getting stronger and, in some areas, has taken over rival Taliban positions.

“In some areas white flags [Taliban’s] have been replaced by black flags [IS’s] … this is a major threat and we have shared our concerns with the central government,"" Zabul governor Bismillah Afghanmal told Radio Liberty.

According to the head of the provincial council in Zabul, IS has established military bases in at least four districts of the province.

Islamic State expands recruiting

Officials in central Ghazni province, which borders Zabul, told VOA that IS has been recruiting in three districts.

“The situation in these areas is worrisome … fighters from Uzbekistan have settled along with their families in some remote mountainous areas and have been trying to recruit locals into their ranks,"" Khaleqdad Akbari, head of the provincial council in Ghazni, told VOA.

IS launched its operation in the AF-Pak region in early 2015 after establishing bases in remote eastern border areas of Afghanistan. The group calls Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of Iran its so-called Islamic State of Khorasan Province, and allegedly takes orders from leaders in Syria.

Pakistani officials say that they have arrested hundreds of IS operatives from different cities within the past two years, but they insist the Middle Eastern group has no organized presence in Pakistan.

Eight militants captured

Authorities in Pakistan last week said they captured a group of eight militants in Lahore, operating at the behest of IS. An IS militant was killed last week during a police raid in Murree city, near Islamabad. And IS claimed responsibility for an attack on a shrine in Baluchistan province this month that killed more than 50 people.

According to a Pakistani newspaper, The News, at least 14 Pakistanis traveled last month to Syria to join IS.

 — 
ISIS says it carried out the suicide bomb attack Monday in the Afghan capital of Kabul which killed at least 30 people and left more than 70 injured.

The explosion occurred when the bomber detonated their vest inside a mosque in the sixth police district of Kabul, according to Basir Mujahid, spokesman for the local police force.

Mujahid told CNN that children and women were among the victims.

ISIS claim
ISIS claimed responsibility via a statement published by its media wing, Amaq news agency.

The statement said that it targeted the Shia gathering in Kabul but did not disclose any information on the identity of the suicide bomber.

The attack took place at 12:10 p.m. (2:40 a.m. ET) after a suicide attacker entered Shia mosque Baqir ul-Uloom as religious worshipers gathered to mark the Shia ceremony of Arbaeen, which comes 40 days after the major festival of Ashura.
Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad who was killed in the year 680 AD.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid has denied the group is responsible for Monday’s attack.

‘Appalling’ attack
“This appalling attack on worshipers is an atrocity,” Pernille Kardel, the UN Secretary-General’s deputy special representative for Afghanistan, said in a statement.

“UNAMA expresses its revulsion at this latest effort by extremists to stoke sectarian violence in Afghanistan,” said Kardel, who is also the acting head of the United Nations’ mission in Afghanistan.

“Religious and ethnic tolerance are values the Afghan people hold strong, and I urge the Afghan authorities to do everything possible to defend Afghans of all faiths,” she said.

The US embassy in Kabul also condemned the attack, calling it a “senseless and cowardly” act.

“This attack is another demonstration of contempt for religious tolerance and communal harmony by the enemies of peace and progress in Afghanistan,” the embassy said in a statement.

Spate of violence
Last week a suicide attack near the Defense Ministry in Kabul killed four people and wounded 11, the latest in a series of attacks which have come around the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks and the beginning of the subsequent US “war on terror.”

On November 11, four Americans were killed in an attack at Bagram Airfield.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for that strike, praising the “strong attack” on Bagram Airfield in a tweet.

In a statement, Mujahid said a suicide bomber had targeted “a sports ground where more than 100 military officers, important people and soldiers were busy exercising.”

In the same week, a suicide attack targeting the German consulate in northern Balkh province killed four others.",https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/21/asia/afghanistan-suicide-bomb-mosque/index.html

A statement in Arabic from Islamic State’s Amaq news agency said one of its fighters had targeted the mosque.

Bloody sectarian rivalry between Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims has been relatively rare in Afghanistan, a majority Sunni country, but the attack underlines the deadly new dimension that growing ethnic tension could bring to its decades-long conflict.

Fraidoon Obaidi, chief of the Kabul police Criminal Investigation Department, said at least 27 people were killed and 35 wounded, while the United Nations said at least 32 had been killed and more than 50 wounded, including many children. It described the attack as “an atrocity”.

“I saw people screaming and covered in blood,” one survivor told Afghanistan’s Ariana Television, adding that around 40 dead and 80 wounded had been taken from the building before rescue services arrived at the scene.

Another witness said he had helped carry 30-35 bodies from the mosque.

Islamic State, based mainly in the eastern state of Nangarhar on the border with Pakistan, has gradually expanded its reach since emerging in Afghanistan last year with a reputation for hardline fundamentalism and brutality.

Prior to Monday’s attack, it had claimed responsibility for two major attacks on Shi’ite targets in Kabul, including a suicide bombing which killed more than 80 people at a demonstration by the mainly Shi’ite Hazara community, the worst single attack on civilians since 2001.Last month, it also claimed an attack in which 18 people were killed when a gunman in police uniform opened fire on worshippers gathered at a shrine in Kabul for Ashura, one of the holiest occasions in the Shi’ite calendar.

In addition, at least 14 people were killed in an attack on a Shi’ite mosque in northern Balkh province, for which no group has so far claimed responsibility.

The Taliban, itself fiercely opposed to Islamic State, had already denied any involvement.

“We have never attacked mosques as it’s not our agenda,” said the movement’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid.

Officials said the attack was a deliberate attempt to stoke sectarian tensions.

Any resurgence of sectarian or ethnic violence could threaten the fragile stability of the government headed by President Ashraf Ghani, who described the mosque blast as an attempt “to sow seeds of discord”.

Government Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah said Afghanistan should not fall victim to “enemy plots that divide us by titles”.

“This attack targeted innocent civilians - including children - in a holy place. It is a war crime & an act against Islam & humanity,” he said in a message on his Twitter account.

",By Mirwais Harooni-Reuters,"Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a crowded mosque in Kabul that killed more than 30 people and wounded dozens in its third major attack on minority Shias in the Afghan capital since July. More than 80 people were injured, according to Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s ministry of public health. The number of dead, which included at least one child, was expected to rise.

The attack, on Monday afternoon, targeted the Baqir ul-Uloom mosque in the Darulaman area. It took place towards the end of a prayer ceremony marking Arbaeen, a religious observance on the 40th day of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, perceived by Shias to be the rightful heir to the prophet Muhammad.

Jamil Yawari, 22, who was injured in the blast and woke up in hospital after being flung into a wall by the explosion, said the mosque was crowded at the time of the attack. “In my line, I sat next to three or four children,” he said.A statement in Arabic from Isis’s Amaq news agency said one of its fighters had targeted the mosque. It is the third time in as many months that Kabul’s Shias have been targeted in a large-scale attack. In October, a gunman attacked another Shia mosque in Kabul where mourners had gathered to mark Ashura, Imam Hussein’s death day.

Affiliates of Isis claimed culpability for that attack, in which at least 14 people died, and for an attack in July, which killed at least 80 protesters who were mainly Hazaras, a Shia minority.

While Afghanistan has traditionally avoided sectarian conflict on a level that plagues other countries in the region, the recent emergence of fighters loyal to Isis, a Sunni group, has coincided with a recent spate of terrorist attacks against Shias.

The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, condemned the attack, which he called “a great crime and the work of the enemies of the people of Afghanistan”.

The president “considers attacks on sacred and religious sites to be clear enmity with Islam and the people of Afghanistan as well as an attempt to sow seeds of discord”, a statement said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/kabul-mosque-hit-by-deadly-suicide-bomb-attack

The attacker entered the Baqir ul Olum mosque in the western part of the city as people were preparing for prayers, a police official said.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, though the country has long been in the grip of an insurgency by the Islamist Taliban, who often carry out attacks. The extremist group ""Islamic State"" has also claimed attacks in the country.

The Afghan government has been seeking in recent months to negotiate a deal with Taliban forces, signing a peace deal in October with warlord Hekmatyar, for example, whose group has been accused of attacking Afghan and foreign troops across the country.

","By RAHIM FAIEZ and AMIR SHAH, Associated Press","KABUL, Afghanistan — A suicide bomber struck a Shiite mosque in the Afghan capital on Monday, killing 32 people, the U.N. office said, the second large-scale attack targeting minority Shiites in Kabul in just over a month.

Hours later, the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. monitoring service that tracks militant postings.

Afghan police said the bomber, who was on foot, had walked into the Shiite mosque in western Kabul where he detonated his explosives among a crowd of worshippers.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said the explosion also wounded more than 50 people, many of them children. Earlier in the day, the Afghan authorities said at least 28 people were killed and 48 wounded.

In its statement, IS said the group’s martyr hit a gathering of close to 1,000 inside a “temple of Shiite polytheists” in Kabul and detonated his vest bearing 16 kilograms (35 pounds) of explosives, SITE said. IS claimed nearly 200 Shiites were killed and wounded. However, militants often exaggerate their claims.

Sunni extremists such as the Taliban and IS militants view Shiites as heretics and apostates and frequently target Shiite mosques and public gatherings.

“This appalling attack on worshippers is an atrocity,” the statement quoted Pernille Kardel, the Secretary-General’s Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan. “UNAMA expresses its revulsion at this latest effort by extremists to stoke sectarian violence in Afghanistan.”

Monday’s bombing hit during a prayers ceremony commemorating 40 days since the anniversary of the death of Imam Hussein, the slain grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. The ceremony is known as Arbaeen, meaning ‘forty’ in Arabic. Hussein is a revered Shiite martyr who was killed in 680 A.D. in the city of Karbala in present-day Iraq.

In early October, militants attacked another Shiite ceremony at a shrine in Kabul, commemorating the anniversary of Hussein’s actual death. That attack killed 17 people, mostly worshippers but also several policemen. A day later, a similar attack struck Shiites in the city of Mazer-e Sharif in northern Balkh province, killing at least 14 people.

The IS affiliate in Afghanistan also claimed responsibility for one of those two attacks, the U.N. statement said.


Faredoon Obiadi, head of the criminal investigation department for the Kabul police, said the attacker in Monday’s bombing walked into the Baqir-ul Ulom mosque and mingled among the crowd on the first floor of the two-story building where he detonated his explosives.

“Suddenly, a huge explosion happened, then everything went dark,” said Ewaz Ali, 50, who was inside the mosque but suffered only minor wounds.

Kardel from UNAMA added in her statement that “religious and ethnic tolerance are values the Afghan people hold strong.”

“I urge the Afghan authorities to do everything possible to defend Afghans of all faiths,” she added.

U.S. Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of the U.S.-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, condemned the bombing.


“On behalf of the men and women of Resolute Support, we offer our condolences to the families of the innocent men, women and children killed and wounded in today’s attack,” Nicholson said. “We will continue to stand with our Afghan partners and do everything possible to secure a peaceful, stable Afghanistan.”

Shiites in Afghanistan make up an estimated 15 percent of the country’s population of around 30 million. Their public celebrations and commemorations were largely banned during the five years when the Taliban controlled the country. But Afghanistan’s Shiites have become more public since the extremists were overthrown in the U.S. invasion of 2001.

In July this year, a suicide bomber targeted ethic Hazaras, who are mostly Shiite, as they marched through central Kabul to protest discrimination. At least 80 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in that attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.

In 2011, at least 54 people were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at a Shiite shrine in Kabul where hundreds of people had gathered to mark the Ashoura.

The Islamic State group emerged for the first time last year in Afghanistan as an offshoot of the militant group fighting in Iraq and Syria. Analysts believe the affiliate in Afghanistan is mostly made up of disenfranchised Taliban fighters.",https://www.columbian.com/news/2016/nov/21/suicide-bomber-targets-shiite-mosque-in-kabul-killing-32/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+the-columbian-headlines+%28The+Columbian%3A+Headlines%29

The group, facing relentless attacks against its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, appears to be targeting Afghanistan’s Shi’ite community, whose lot has substantially improved since the demise of the hard-line Taliban regime in late 2001.

IS claimed responsibility for the November 21 attack by a suicide bomber inside a Shi’ite mosque in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Afghan officials say at least 30 people were killed and scores more were injured in the attack.

“A martyrdom attack by an Islamic State fighter targets a Shi’ite [shrine] in the city of Kabul,"" the group's Aamaq Agency said in a newsflash.

This is the third major IS attack against Shi’a in the capital this year. Nearly 100 people were killed in attacks on Shi’ite protesters and worshipers in Kabul in July and October.

Hekmatullah Azamy, a researcher at the Kabul-based Centre for Conflict & Peace Studies, says the Kabul attacks are in line with IS’s grand strategy.

“They want to foment a larger [global] struggle between Shi’a and Sunni Muslims,” he said. “Their focus on targeting the Shi’a in Kabul showcases this approach.”

Azamy noted that while the main IS presence in Afghanistan is limited to remote mountainous regions in eastern Nangarhar Province, the group is focused on attacking Shi’ite communities in Kabul some 200 kilometers away.

“Daesh seems to be the future of militancy in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the broader region,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.

A local chapter of IS, which branded itself Wilayat Khorasan, first emerged in Nangarhar in late 2014. By summer 2015, it controlled large swathes of the province, particularly six districts along its eastern border with Pakistan.

Its reliance on extreme violence against civilians, government forces, and even the Taliban has provoked a tribal uprising, ground operations by the Afghan Army, and NATO air strikes. In some cases, however, the Taliban have ousted IS fighters from Nangarhar pockets.

Afghan lawmakers still see the group as resilient and recently urged Kabul to rid Nangarhar of its presence.

“People need to pay close attention to this group because, unlike other militant groups in this region, it is not influenced by any state here,” Azamy said. “IS has now positioned itself as the second-most influential group in Afghanistan following the Taliban.”

Lawmaker Ramzan Bashardost, a member of the Shi’ite Hazara minority community, remains skeptical of IS’s ability to succeed in Afghanistan.

“This is pure barbarity. As long as there are B-52 bombers here, it is impossible to foment a sectarian war,” he said, referring to the long-range U.S. bombers that many Afghans credited as playing a vital role in ousting the hard-line Taliban regime 15 years ago.

“So long as the Hazara leaders enjoy a major share in power, they will be reluctant to join any sectarian strife despite such attacks,” Bashardost said.

Sectarian violence between the majority Sunni, who make up nearly 85 percent of Afghanistan’s 30 million population, and the minority Shi’a has never featured as a key driver of the country’s various cycles of war since the late 1970s.

Since the overthrow of the Taliban regime, the once-marginalized Hazaras, who constitute a bulk of Afghanistan’s Shi’ite community, have enjoyed senior leadership positions in both the civilian and military parts of the Afghan government. Meanwhile, the lot of impoverished Hazara communities has also improved.

Afghan government leaders are also adamant that IS’s sectarian bid must fail.

President Ashraf Ghani characterized the November 21 attack as “an attempt to sow seeds of discord” but warned that ""terrorists cannot achieve their masters' goals by spreading fear,"" he said in a statement.

Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah called the bombing an act against Islam and humanity.

“While we mourn the loss of our loved ones, we must make sure to work for unity and avoid the enemy plots that divide us by titles,” he wrote on Twitter.",https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/afghaistan-sectarian-war/28131444.html

President Ashraf Ghani in a statement condemned the “barbaric” attack.

Several police vehicles raced from the scene and ferried the wounded to hospital.

Worshippers were gathering to mark the Shia ceremony of Arbaeen, which comes 40 days after the day of mourning, Ashura.

Ashura commemorates the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad who was killed in battle in 680 AD. His fate laid the foundation for the faith practised by the Shia community, a minority in mainly Sunni-Muslim Afghanistan.

Arbaeen marks the end of the mourning period over his death.

The ISIL group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement via its affiliated Amaq website, after the Taliban said it was not involved.

Earlier this year a powerful blast targeting Shia worshippers during Ashura killed 14 people in northern Afghanistan.Officials to investigate Afghan attacks
In July, ISIL group claimed responsibility for twin explosions that ripped through crowds of Shia Hazaras in Kabul, killing at least 85 people and wounding more than 400 others.

The bombings marked the deadliest single attack in the capital since the Taliban were ousted from power in the US-led invasion of 2001.

Shia Muslims in Afghanistan make up an estimated 15 percent of the country’s population of about 30 million.

Their public celebrations and commemorations were largely banned during the years when the Taliban controlled the country. But Afghanistan’s Shia community has become more public since the Taliban was ousted. 

Critics said the government needs to do more to protect places of worship.

“Given the level of Shia-Sunni polarisation in the region, more tragic attacks of this sort are expected, while the Afghan government resorts only to verbal condemnation of such acts,” Al Jazeera’s Afghanistan analyst Hashmat Moslih said.

Amnesty International also took the government to task.

“[Afghan authorities] have a duty to take effective measures to protect Shia Muslims from attacks,” said Champa Patel, Amnesty’s South Asia director.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/22/deaths-as-suicide-bomber-attacks-shia-mosque-in-kabul

 ","The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist group claimed responsibility behind the deadly suicide attack on a mosque in Kabul city.

The group issued a statement in Arabic via its media wing ‘Amaq’ news agency and claimed that the attack was carried out by its suicide bomber on a Shi’ite mosque in the city.

The Taliban militants group earlier rejected that the group is involved in the attack.

At least 32 people were killed and 85 others were wounded after the suicide bomber detonated his explosives among the worshipers in Baqir-ul-Olum mosque in west of Kabul city this afternoon.

The officials in public health ministry confirmed that 85 people wounded in the attack were taken to hospitals for treatment.

This is the second deadly attack the ISIS terrorist group is claiming responsibility for within the past one and half month.

At least 18 people were killed and 36 others were wounded after a group of gunmen belonging to ISIS terrorist group stormed into Sakhi shrine in Kabul city last month.

The attack on Sakhi shrine was carried out as hundreds of mourners had gathered in the area to observe the Ashura day.

The group earlier claimed the attack on a major demonstration in Kabul that left at least 85 rally participants dead and scores of others wounded.",https://www.khaama.com/isis-claims-responsibility-behind-kabul-mosque-bombing-that-left-32-dead-02331/

Isis claims responsibility for Kabul mosque suicide bomb blast",Mon 21 Nov 2016 16.05 GMT,Sune Engel Rasmussen in Kabul-TheGuardian,"Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a crowded mosque in Kabul that killed more than 30 people and wounded dozens in its third major attack on minority Shias in the Afghan capital since July. More than 80 people were injured, according to Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s ministry of public health. The number of dead, which included at least one child, was expected to rise.

The attack, on Monday afternoon, targeted the Baqir ul-Uloom mosque in the Darulaman area. It took place towards the end of a prayer ceremony marking Arbaeen, a religious observance on the 40th day of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, perceived by Shias to be the rightful heir to the prophet Muhammad.

Jamil Yawari, 22, who was injured in the blast and woke up in hospital after being flung into a wall by the explosion, said the mosque was crowded at the time of the attack. “In my line, I sat next to three or four children,” he said.
Images circulating on social media, purportedly from the scene, showed numerous dusty and bloodied bodies spread across the mosque floor.A statement in Arabic from Isis’s Amaq news agency said one of its fighters had targeted the mosque. It is the third time in as many months that Kabul’s Shias have been targeted in a large-scale attack. In October, a gunman attacked another Shia mosque in Kabul where mourners had gathered to mark Ashura, Imam Hussein’s death day.

Affiliates of Isis claimed culpability for that attack, in which at least 14 people died, and for an attack in July, which killed at least 80 protesters who were mainly Hazaras, a Shia minority.

While Afghanistan has traditionally avoided sectarian conflict on a level that plagues other countries in the region, the recent emergence of fighters loyal to Isis, a Sunni group, has coincided with a recent spate of terrorist attacks against Shias.

The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, condemned the attack, which he called “a great crime and the work of the enemies of the people of Afghanistan”.

The president “considers attacks on sacred and religious sites to be clear enmity with Islam and the people of Afghanistan as well as an attempt to sow seeds of discord”, a statement said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/kabul-mosque-hit-by-deadly-suicide-bomb-attack

    Kabul suicide strikes


      The Kabul blasts targeted a van carrying administrative staffers of the Afghan parliament near the parliament compound and the private American University of Afghanistan.
  

      Video distributed by Reuters showed numerous armed security personnel standing near the scene. 
  

      The violence began when a suicide attacker on foot detonated a bomb near the van, Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said. 
  

      The second blast came from a vehicle that exploded when police arrived to help victims, said Ahmad Wali, a Kabul district police chief.
  

      Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the Taliban were targeting members of the Afghanistanâ€™s intelligence agency.

      The blasts happened in the late afternoon on Darulaman Road, according to the university. 
  

      The university was at least indirectly affected by attacks and kidnappings by Taliban-linked insurgents last year. 
  

      In August, two teachers â€“ an American and an Australian â€“ were abducted near the school. Days later, a rescue attempt by US Special Operations forces from SEAL Team 6 failed when the teachers were not found at the targeted location.
  

      Three weeks after the kidnappings, gunmen wearing suicide vests stormed the campus and killed 12 people, including students, security guards and police.
  

      The American University of Afghanistan opened in 2006. Itâ€™s the only private, nonprofit, coed university in that country and has about 1,700 full- and part-time students. The school is regarded as a symbol of cooperation between Afghanistan and the United States.
  

    Kandahar blast


      The explosion in the southern province of Kandahar ripped through a guesthouse of the governorâ€™s compound Tuesday evening, according Khpalwak.
  

      Abdullah Khodadad, director of press and public relations for the Afghan Embassy in Washington, confirmed the death of diplomat Yama Quraishi.
  

      Quraishi was head of Afghanistanâ€™s passport section in Washington. He is the nephew of Karzaiâ€™s wife.â€
  

      â€œHe was doing his masterâ€™s in George Mason University in the field of conflict resolution,â€ Khodadad said.
  

      Kandahar Gov. Humayun Azizi and the UAE envoy, Juma Mohammed Abdullah Al Kaabi, were lightly wounded, Khpalwak said.
  

      The UAE is closely monitoring what it called a terrorist attack.
  

      There have been no initial claims of responsibility.

An explosion tore through the al-Zahra mosque in Dasht-e-Barchi in PD 13 in Kabul city shortly before 9pm on Thursday night.

Sources have said at least six people, including one policeman, were killed and more than ten wounded in the attack. 

The explosion happened while people around the country were preparing to observe the Lailatul-Qadr (night of power) which is held on 19th, 21st and 23rd day of Ramadan and mosques on this occasion are very crowded.
 
The attack happened at a Shia ceremony.

Among those killed was prominent Kabul businessman Ramazan Husainzada, who was known as Haji Ramazan. According to a source, he was badly wounded in the attack and died in hospital from his injuries. The Ministry of Interior (MoI) has confirmed that suicide attackers stormed the mosque, however there have been conflicting reports regarding the number of attackers.

Kabul police however said two attackers were involved. 
 
According to a TOLOnews journalist close to the scene, security forces have cordoned off the area.

One suicide bomber reportedly detonated his explosives at the mosque while a second was shot by mosque security guards.

Eye witnesses report that a third attacker could also have been involved.

The Tablian has rejected any involvement in the attack.

The attackers then took refuge in the mosqueâ€™s kitchen before detonating a bomb.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility for the deadly attack via its news agency Amaq.
Among the dead were at least three civilians and one police officer, while four civilians and four police officers were wounded.
The attack happened as mosques around the city were crowded for a night of religious observances as part of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistanâ€˜s chief executive, condemned the blast on Twitter.Â

Among those killed was also Haji Ramazan, a well-known businessman who built the Al Zahra mosque
The attack comes at a time when Kabul is already on edge, following a wave of deadly bombings, which triggered angry public protests calling for the resignation of President Ashraf Ghaniâ€˜s government over spiralling insecurity.
Health ministry officials said Kabul ambulances carried the dead and wounded victims to the hospital.
The Al Zahra mosque, located in west Kabul, is used by the Shia minority, who have been targeted by suicide bombings in the past.
An attack on a Shia mosque in November killed more than 30 people.

Recent bomb attacks in Kabul have been claimed either by the Taliban or so-called Islamic State (IS).The attack was followed by a series of protests against the deterioration of security, during which five people died when police fired on protesters.Suicide bombers later targeted the funeral of one of the protesters, killing at least seven people. Another 100 people were injured.Why are people being attacked during Ramadan?In recent years, there seems to have been a noticeable spike in violence during Ramadan - despite it being a time for penance and temperance.But while most Muslims view it as such, Shiraz Maher, of King's College London, explained in an article for the BBC last year that others see it differently.""For 30 days, Muslims abstain from drink and food during sunlight hours and believe that God is at his most forgiving during this time,"" he wrote.""Mosques are consequently fuller than usual, typically packed with worshippers seeking divine mercy and blessings.""Juxtaposed alongside that ascetic puritanism is the view of radicals who regard Ramadan as a month of conquest and plunder.""They believe it is an opportune moment to double down on their millenarian war against civilisation and therefore launch more attacks than normal.""More on this storyWhy so-called Islamic State chooses to bomb during Ramadan5 July 2016The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan12 January 2017Kabul suicide bomb toll soars past 1506 June 2017",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40296509

Four hours of gunfire, explosions
After the blast at theÂ Imam Zaman mosque in Afghan capitalâ€™s Qala-Najara neighbourhood, gunmen stormed in and began shooting.
Terrified worshippers endured about four harrowing hours of gunfire and explosions during the afternoon before the four attackers were killed.
The cleric who was performing the prayers was among the dead, said Mir Hussain Nasiri, a member of Afghanistanâ€™s Shia clerical council.Â 
The mosque is large and can accomodate up to 1,000 people.
Policemen made an attempt to enter the mosque but withdrew after one of the attackers set off an explosion, said police official Mohammad Sadiq Muradi.
â€œThe attackers are slaughtering people like sheep, but thereâ€™s no one to go and rescue them,â€ Murtaza, a young boy whose parents were trapped inside, said as the assault unfolded. â€œA lot of people are on the ground, and no one is trying to rescue them.â€
A sprawling cavernous prayer hall dominates the main floor. The second floor is where the women pray.
Nasiri said when police initially sought to get into the mosque, the attackers blocked the door leading to the second floor, which he said would mean they held the women hostage.

Al Jazeeraâ€™s Jennifer Glasse, reporting from the scene, quoted eyewitnesses as saying the assailants had run out of ammunition and started stabbing worshippers with knives. Some of the victims included children and women.
â€œIt was a busy time, in the middle of Friday prayer as the attack took place,â€ said Glasse.
ISILâ€™s affiliate in Afghanistan claimed responsibility. ISIL-linked Aamaq website said on Friday two of its fighters carried out the assault. It did not give further details.
The attack was the latest by ISIL to hit the Afghan capital. Last month it hit the Iraqi embassy in Kabul and afterwards issued a warning to all Shia in Afghanistan, saying its cadres would attack Shia places of worship.
Within days of the embassy attack, ISIL also took responsibility for a suicide assault on a Shia mosque in western Herat province that killed 32 people.

ISIS is claiming responsibility for an attack Friday on a Shiite Muslim mosque in the Afghan capital of Kabul that authorities said left 20 people dead.

The attack began early Friday afternoon when one of three attackers blew himself up at the gate of the Imam Zaman Mosque as worshippers were attending Friday prayers, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish. The remaining attackers stormed the mosque and fired on security forces.
Authorities killed the gunmen after a nearly four-hour firefight, Danish said.

At least 20 people have died, and 50 others were injured, according to Ismail Kawosi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health. Earlier, officials said two police officers were among the dead.ISIS claimed responsibility, saying in a statement posted by its Amaq News Agency that suicide bombers from the group attacked the mosque.

It’s at least the second time this month that ISIS has claimed responsibility for an attack targeting Shiite worshippers in Afghanistan.

The terror group also said it was behind a dual suicide blast at a mosque in the western city of Herat on August 1. That attack killed more than 30 people as they gathered for evening prayers, according to local officials.",https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/25/asia/kabul-bomb-blast-mosque/index.html

Â© 2017 Reuters



(New York) â€“ The attack on a Shia mosque in Kabul claimed by the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) on August 25, 2017, is a serious violation of the laws of war, and an apparent war crime, Human Rights Watch said today. The hours-long attack on the Imam Zaman mosque in the Qala-e Najara neighborhood of northern Kabul killed at least 20 people and wounded at least 30 others, media reports said.
	The attackers, reportedly wearing police uniforms, initiated the assault with a grenade attack and then entered the mosque and fired on worshipers. Gun battles continued for several hours. An armed group claiming allegiance to the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) reportedly claimed responsibility.
	â€œAn attack on a place of worship during prayers is a horrific crime meant to maximize civilian deaths,â€ said Patricia Gossman, senior Afghanistan researcher. â€œThis contemptible act against a religious minority, claimed by ISISâ€™s Afghan affiliate, is a grim reminder that civilians bear the brunt of Afghanistanâ€™s war.â€




    This contemptible act against a religious minority is a grim reminder that civilians bear the brunt of Afghanistanâ€™s war.
          





Patricia Gossman


Senior Afghanistan Researcher 



	The attack is similar to others that ISIS affiliates have committed over the past year targeting Afghanistanâ€™s Shia minority. On August 1, an attack claimed by ISKP on a Shia mosque in Herat killed at least 20 and wounded more than 30. Since July 2016, sectarian suicide attacks have injured or killed hundreds of members of the Shia community in Afghanistan. This wave of attacks on Shia is largely attributable to the emergence of militant groups affiliated with ISIS.
	Attacks deliberately targeting civilians in Afghanistan have increased sharply in the past year. In its most recent report, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said that it recorded more civilian deaths and injury from suicide and complex attacks in the first half of 2017 than in any previous period. The countryâ€™s overall security environment has been worsening in the face of an intensifying insurgency, claiming high levels of civilian casualties as fighting increasingly occurs in densely populated areas.
	Under the laws of war, deliberate attacks on civilians or civilian objects such as houses of worship are war crimes. Dressing as civilian police to carry out a military attack is also a war crime. Criminal acts such as murder committed by state security forces or armed groups as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population such as a religious minority are crimes against humanity.
	â€œInsurgents who carry out atrocities against a specific ethnic or religious community are committing war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity,â€ Gossman said. â€œAll parties to Afghanistanâ€™s conflict should recognize that such grave international crimes may be prosecuted anywhere in the world at any time.â€

ISLAMABAD â€”Â 
Afghan officials say a suicide attack on a Shi'ite mosque in Kabul killed at least 20 people, including two police officers, and wounded more than 40 others during Friday prayers. .
Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish confirmed that at least one attacker blew himself up at the gate of the Imam Zaman mosque while several others stormed inside.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.

Police cordoned off the area soon after the assault. Residents of the area reported hearing gunfire from inside the mosque
An eyewitness says he saw at least three women and several children wounded and lying on the floor during the incident. Family members of those still in the mosque gathered outside.
Imam Zaman is one of the main Shi'ite mosques in the area and more people attend mosques on a Friday, the Muslim holy day of the week.
The trouble happened days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new policy for Afghanistan in which he gave battlefield decision-making powers to his ground commanders, demanded Pakistan â€œimmediatelyâ€ change its behavior and stop providing havens to the Afghan Taliban, and asked the Afghan government to hasten reform and not take American support for granted.

","Kabul Mosque Attack Death Toll Rises To Over 30
The death toll from a coordinated militant attack on Imam Zaman Mosque in the north of Kabul raised to more than 30, security sources confirmed.

Over 80 others were wounded in the attack and meanwhile more than 100 others were rescued, the sources said.

The Ministry of Public Health however said more than 20 people were killed and over 35 others were wounded in the attack. 

But the ministry spokesman Ismail Kawoosi said the casualties may increase - after they received final information on the incident.

The attack started at 1pm on Friday afternoon when a group of three or four attackers entered the mosque when at least 200 worshippers including women were busy in Friday prayers.

The attackers killed two security guards and wounded two others by throwing hand grenades at them in the entrance of the mosque, the Interior Ministry officials said.  

Eyewitnesses said the security forces arrived at the scene two hours following the attack. However, the Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said the Crisis Response Unit of the Afghan National Police arrived at the attack scene sharply after it happened.

Many explosions were later heard from the area during the clearance operation by the Crisis Response Unit.

Danish said police rescued more than 100 worshippers who were caught in the fight between security forces and the attackers.

The attack on Imam Zaman Mosque in Kabul’s PD11 continued for five hours.  

“The attack was carried out by three or four men and that one of them blew himself up outside the mosque, according to initial information,” Danish told TOLOnews.

According to him, at least 12 people were killed and 38 others were wounded in the attack.

President Ashraf Ghani in a statement condemned the attack and called it a crime against the people of Afghanistan.

The president called on Afghan religious scholars to raise their voice against such violent acts - carried by terrorists, the Presidential Palace said in a statement.

This is not the first attack on sacred places in the country. At least six people were killed when Al-Zahra Mosque in the west of Kabul was targeted by a blast in mid-June. 

Earlier this month, at least 29 people were killed and dozens others were wounded in an attack on Jawadia Mosque in Herat city in Afghanistan’s west.",https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/kabul-mosque-attack-death-toll-rises-over-30

A suicide bomber and gunmen attacked a Shiite mosque, killing at least two people in an ongoing attack in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Friday, officials said, the latest deadly assault to highlight deteriorating security.
Gunshots and explosions could be heard and witnesses reported seeing worshippers smash windows to escape the building, which was believed to have been packed with dozens of men, women and children when the assailants struck during Friday prayers.
Heavily-armed security forces have surrounded the mosque in a residential area in the north of the city, and tempers quickly frayed as onlookers called for them to storm the building.
 



Kabul police spokesman Abdul Basir Mujahid told AFP a suicide bomber â€œdetonated himself inside the mosqueâ€ and a health ministry official said at least two people had died while 11 were wounded, without specifying if they were civilians.
An interior ministry spokesman told media that at least two police officers had been killed.
People gathered outside the mosque were trying to call women and children trapped inside but their mobile phones were not responding, an AFP reporter at the scene said.
â€œOur relatives have been stranded inside the mosqueâ€¦ We believe they have been held hostage by the gunmen. We are very concerned about their safety and may God help us and rescue our loved ones,â€ one of the onlookers said.
The attackers were holed up in the womenâ€™s section, Sayed Jan Agha, who works in the mosque and whose mother is one of those trapped inside, told AFP.
â€œThe bombers are running short of bullet rounds and they are using knives to stab worshippers,â€ another eyewitness said.
Witnesses said the attackers were also armed with rocket propelled grenade launchers.
Pools of blood
The assault underscores spiralling insecurity in Afghanistan as a resurgent Taliban steps up offensives across the country, while the Sunni Islamic State group, known for carrying out sectarian attacks, expands its Afghan footprint.
It comes just days after US President Donald Trump cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be deployed in the war-torn country.
Najib Danish, a deputy spokesman for the interior ministry, told TOLOnews that initial information suggested a suicide bomber detonated himself and two or three other militants had entered the mosque and were exchanging fire with police.
â€œTwo Afghan police forces were martyred and two others were wounded and have been taken to hospital. All the four police officers were responsible for the security of the site,â€ Danish wrote on Facebook.
More than 10 ambulances were at the scene to take the wounded to local hospitals. Some relatives flocked to a nearby private hospital to search for loved ones who had been in the mosque at the time of the attack.
Pools of blood could be seen at the entrance to the medical facility.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Shiites, a minority of around three million in overwhelmingly Sunni Afghanistan, have regularly been targeted by IS jihadists recently. They accuse police and troops of failing to protect them.
IS has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks killing dozens of Shiites in Kabul over the past year, including twin explosions in July 2016 that ripped through crowds of Shiite Hazaras, killing at least 85 people and wounding more than 400.
Earlier this month 33 worshippers were killed and 66 wounded in a suicide attack claimed by IS on a Shiite mosque in the western Afghan city of Herat.

At Least 20 People Killed In Kabul Shi'ite Mosque Attack

","
A senior Afghan health official says at least 20 people were killed after militants stormed a Shiâ€™ite mosque in the capital, Kabul, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State (IS) extremist group. 
Mohammad Salim Rasouli, chief of Kabul's hospitals, said at least 50 more were wounded, many of them children, in the hours-long attack on August 25. 
Police said two suicide bombers blew themselves up at the entrance of the Imam Zaman Mosque in Kabulâ€™s Qala-e Najara area, while two other attackers stormed the building. 
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish told RFE/RL that the â€œterrorist attackâ€ took place at around 1:20 p.m. where worshippers had gathered for Friday prayers.
Danish said two police officers were among the dead. 
A cleric who was leading the service in the mosque was among those killed, according to reports.
Meanwhile, police official Mohammed Sadique Muradi said the attack ended with all four attackers dead.
Two of them blew themselves up and another two were later shot by Afghan security forces, Muradi said.
Kabul police spokesman Abdul Basir Mujahid said a suicide bomber ""detonated himself inside the mosque.""
Witnesses said that gunmen threw grenades before entering the mosque.
The IS-linked Amaq news agency said the groupâ€™s affiliate in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Shiâ€™a are a minority in Afghanistan who have been threatened and attacked in the past by various Sunni militant groups -- including IS and Taliban extremists.
Last month, IS militants attacked the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul that killed two local employees and later threatened to attack Shiâ€™ite places of worship in Afghanistan.
And on August 1, at least 32 people were killed and more than 60 injured by a suicide bomber and a gunman who targeted a Shiâ€™ite mosque in the western city of Herat in an attack claimed by the IS group.
The August 25 assault comes after President Donald Trump outlined earlier this week the new U.S. strategy for the war-torn country.
It also underscores increased insecurity in Afghanistan as a resurgent Taliban steps up offensives across the country.

Can Trump succeed in ending the war in Afghanistan?






The blast occurred on a street lined with shops and banks at a time when many officials were collecting their salaries before the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday at the end of the week.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.Â 
Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the group, said the bomber targeted a section of the bank where soldiers and police were waiting to receive their salaries.Â 
In another development, at least 13 civilians, including women and children, were killed in an overnight air attack by Afghan security forces that targeted the Taliban in western Herat province, according to Gelani Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor.
Farhad told The Associated Press news agency that the Monday night attack in Shindand district also wounded seven civilians. A Taliban base and a prison run by the fighters were targeted, he said.
The prison was destroyed and 19 prisoners â€“ both military and civilians â€“ escaped. The civilians who were killed died in their homes just next to the Taliban base, he added.
According to the spokesman, the air attacks also killed 16 Taliban fighters.
The Taliban have not commented on the Herat attack and Farhadâ€™s information could not be independently verified.

Tuesdayâ€™s blast was the latest in a long series of suicide attacks in Kabul, where 209 civilians were killed and 777 injured in the first half of the year alone, according to figures by the UN.
It came three months after a massive truck bomb ripped through the same area, killing at least 150 people.
President Ashraf Ghaniâ€™s government has started tightening security around the centre of the city, where many of the most deadly attacks have taken place. 
Earlier this month, the Taliban pledged to turn Afghanistan into a â€œgraveyardâ€ for foreign forces after US President Donald Trump committed American troops indefinitely to the war there.

Suicide Bombing Kills Five At Bank In Kabul

Afghan officials say a suicide bomber has blown himself up at a bank in the center of Kabul, killing at least five people and wounding eight others.
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said the bomber hit the entrance to a Kabul Bank branch on August 29, about 500 meters from the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy compound.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had targeted security-forces personnel withdrawing their salaries.
Attacks on banks where soldiers and police withdraw their salaries have become a regular tactic of the extremist group.
The latest attack comes ahead of this week's Eid al-Adha celebrations and a week after President Donald Trump outlined the new U.S. strategy for the war-torn country.
Kabul has seen an increase in attacks lately. On August 25, 28 people -- including women and children -- were reported killed and more than 50 others wounded in an attack on a Shi'ite mosque in Kabul claimed by the Islamic State (IS) extremist group.
In another development, reports from the western province of Herat said that an Afghan Air Force air strike targeting Taliban militants left at least 13 civilians dead and seven others injured.
Gelani Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor, said at least 16 Taliban fighters were also killed the overnight air strike targeting a command center and a prison run by the militants in Shindand district.
A member of Herat's provincial council, Haji Toryalai Taheri, spoke of 20 civilian deaths and no Taliban victims.
Farhad said 19 prisoners, both military and civilians, managed to escape after the strike.
The civilians who were killed died in their houses nearby, he added.
The spokesman also said that a fact-finding team had been sent to the area.
The Taliban has not commented on the attack.
According to the UN, the number of air strikes has increased by 43 percent in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same time in 2016. At least 232 civilians were killed and injured in that same period.

As many as 19 others were wounded in the attack close to Hussainia mosqueÂ that came two days before Ashura, the holiest holiday in the Shia religious calendar.
Police official Sadiq Muradi said police confronted the suicide bomber as he came through a checkpoint near the holy site, calling for him to stop. It was then when the attacker ignited his explosives, blowing himself up.

â€œThe bomber was grazing a herd of sheep and before reaching his target he detonated himself 140 metres from Hussainia mosque,â€ General Salim Almas, Kabulâ€™s criminal investigative director, told AFP news agency.
Najibullah Danish, interior ministry spokesman, said that all victims were civilians.
Kabulâ€™s Emergency Hospital tweeted that it had received 19 wounded, including four children.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group claimed responsibility for the attack in a communique, the SITE monitoring group said.
Earlier, the Taliban had been quick to distance themselves from the bombing.Â 
â€œTodayâ€™s Kabul attack has nothing to do with us. After a thorough investigation, we found out that we had no operation in Kabul, and this attack is not linked to us,â€ Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said.Â

There had been fears fighters would attack as Shia Muslims prepare to commemorate Ashura.
The holiday falls on the 10th day of Muharram, which is the mourning period for the seventh-century killing of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.
The faithful gather to beat their chests and hit their backs with chains until they bleed in commemoration of Husseinâ€™s death.
But in recent years the sacred day has been marred by deadly violence.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in the middle of a crowd of worshippers at the main Shia shrine in Kabul on Ashura, killing 80 people, including women and children.
Afghan officials blamed the bombing â€“ the first major sectarian attack on a key religious day in Afghanistan â€“ on Pakistani group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.
Last October, gunmen entered the Karte Sakhi shrine near Kabul University and killed 18 people gathering to mark Ashura, an attack claimed by the ISIL group.
The following day at least 14 Shia were killed in a bombing at a mosque in northern Afghanistan. A few weeks later Baqui-ul-Ulom mosque in Kabul was targeted when a massive suicide blast claimed by ISIL killed dozens of worshippers.

Deadly Suicide Blast Targets Kabul Mosque

ISTANBUL â€”Â 
Afghan officials say a suicide blast outside a Shiâ€™ite Muslim worship place in Kabul has killed at least six people and wounded 27 others.
Witnesses report the bomber was disguised as a sheepherder and tried to enter the crowded facility in the Qala-e Fatehullah area of the capital city when a police guard intercepted and shot at him. The attacker then detonated explosives strapped to his body just as worshipers were dispersing after offering prayers.

The death toll from the powerful blast reportedly is much higher than the official figure, and children also were victims.
President Ashraf Ghani has strongly condemned the bombing, saying such terrorist acts will fail to divide Afghans.










A Taliban spokesman denied the insurgent groupâ€™s involvement, saying it has nothing to do with the bombing.
Local reports say Afghan security forces arrested a second suicide bomber near the site before he could detonate his vest.
Loyalists of Islamic State in Afghanistan have claimed responsibility for attacks on members of the minority Shiâ€™ite community and their mosques.
Fridayâ€™s attack came a month after a suicide bomber killed at least 20 people during prayers at another Shiâ€™ite mosque in the Afghan capital.

Police officer Abdul Rahman said the attacker blew himself up on the street about 1,000 meters (1,094 yards) from the mosque.Police official Sadiq Muradi said police confronted the attacker as he came through a checkpoint near the holy site, calling for him to stop.

But Afghanistan has faced a series of large-scale attacks in recent months targeting minority Shiites for which the Sunni-dominated Islamic State group affiliate in Afghanistan has taken responsibility.In July, IS attacked the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul and then warned Shiites in Afghanistan that their mosques would be targeted. Sunni extremists consider Shiites to be heretics.Within days of that, IS also took responsibility for a suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in western Herat province that left 32 people dead.Last month, militants stormed a packed Shiite mosque in Kabul during Friday prayers in an attack that lasted for hours and ended with at least 20 worshippers killed and another 50 seriously wounded, many of them children. IS claimed it was responsible.Also on Friday, an Afghan official said a Taliban attack on a police checkpoint left five police dead in western Farah province.Iqbal Baher, spokesman for the provincial chief of police, says two others were wounded when the militants launched their attack early Friday in Bala Bluk district.Baher said reinforcements from the Afghan national army arrived after several hours of fighting and pushed the Taliban fighters out of the district.

We had internal fighting in the past but never religious fighting,â€ said Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament and a member of the mainly Shiâ€™ite Hazara community that has been particularly targeted.The government has provided some basic training and weapons for a few hundred volunteer guards near mosques and other meeting places but many fear that the protection, which covers only some of the cityâ€™s more than 400 Shiâ€™ite mosques, is insufficient.In 2011, more than 80 people were killed in Ashura attacks in Kabul and the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and there have been a string of others since, with 20 people killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Kabul a month ago.Fridayâ€™s attack, by suicide bombers posing as shepherds walking their sheep along a road outside the Hussainya mosque in the Qala-e-Fatehullah area of the city, did not reach the mosque itself but wounded 20 people in addition to the five killed.No up-to-date census data exists for Afghanistan but different estimates put the size of the Shiâ€™ite community at between 10-20 percent of the population, mostly Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras.Ashura, on the 10th day of the month of Muharram, celebrates the martyrdom of Hussein, one of the grandsons of the Prophet Mohammad, and is marked by large public commemorations by Shiâ€™ite Muslims.President Ashraf Ghani condemned Fridayâ€™s attack and said it would not break the unity between religions in Afghanistan.But at a time when rivalry between the patchwork of different ethnic groups in the country has increasingly come into the open, Rahmani said the evident objective of the attacks was to ratchet up the tensions to create instability.â€œIn the past, there were warnings that there were groups that wanted to stir ethnic and religious conflict among Afghans but now it is reality,â€ Rahmani said. â€œThere are people who want to create disunity among ethnic and religious groups,â€ he said.Reporting by Mirwais Harooni and James Mackenzie; Editing by Richard PullinOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-afghanistan-security-idUKKCN1C5071

","The ministry of interior confirmed at least 39 people were killed and 45 wounded in the Imam Zaman Mosque attack in Dasht-e-Barchi in Kabul city on Friday evening.

The mosque is located close to Pul-e-Khoshk Square in Dasht-e-Barchi in the west of Kabul City.

The explosion occurred at around 6pm when the worshippers were doing the evening prayer.

Eyewitnesses told TOLOnews that the number of wounded was more than 50.

The eyewitnesses said the suicide bomber was in the middle of the mosque among the worshippers when he detonated the explosives embedded with his body.

According to an eyewitness, women and children were also among the victims of the attack.

Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said in a post on social media that based on initial reports, 20 people were killed and 40 others were wounded in the mosque attack.

Security forces cordoned off the area one hour after the explosion.

The Ministry of Public Health said in a statement that many of the wounded are in critical condition.

Many people were chanting slogans against insurgents outside the mosque few hours after the attack.

President Ashraf Ghani in a statement sent hours after the incident condemned the attacks on Kabul and Ghor mosques and called them inhuman and against the values of Islam. 

The president said the attacks were aimed at creating division among the people, adding that these nefarious acts will not yield any result and will not affect the unity of Afghans.  

Daesh has claimed responsibility of the attack.

Early on Saturday, at least two rockets landed near the international military headquarters in the city's downtown area. Alarms went off at the NATO-led military mission and several foreign embassies nearby. No casualities were reported.
Afghanistan's Shiite minority has witnessed several attacks this year. At least 84 people have beenÂ killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, a United Nations report released last week said.

So-called Islamic State (IS) said it carried out the attack on Kabul's Imam Zaman mosque, but provided no evidence for the claim.

The group has previously targeted Shia mosques across Afghanistan.

The new attacks bring to at least 176 the number of people killed in bomb attacks across the country this week.One eyewitness told the BBC that the scene at the Imam Zaman mosque, in the west of Kabul, looked like a ""front line"".

Another witness, Mahmood Shah Husaini, said people had been praying when the bomber detonated his explosives.

The attacker is reported to have opened fire as worshippers gathered for Friday prayers, before detonating a bomb.

Kabul police spokesman Basir Mojahid confirmed the incident at the Shia mosque in Kabul, but did not give further details.

A spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry said investigators were working at the scene to determine the ""nature of the explosion,"" AFP news agency reports.

The attack on the Sunni mosque in Ghor, central Afghanistan, also killed a pro-government militia commander, according to reports.

Details of the attacks remain unclear and the number of casualties is likely to rise. Dozens of worshippers were also injured, Afghan's health ministry said.
Friday's attacks come just days after police in Kabul said they had arrested a would-be suicide truck bomber, averting a major incident.

In August, more than 20 people were killed in a bomb attack against worshippers in Kabul. IS, a Sunni Islamist militant group, said it had carried out the attack.A truck bomb in the Afghan capital in May killed more than 150 people and wounded some 400 more, most of them civilians. No group claimed to be behind that attack but the US-backed Afghan government accused the Haqqani group, an affiliate of the country's biggest militant group, the Taliban.

Afghanistan has seen a spate of suicide attacks and bombings in recent months.

There have been four major attacks on Afghan security forces this week alone:

On Thursday, 43 Afghan soldiers were killed after two Taliban suicide bombers in Humvee armoured vehicles destroyed a military base in the southern province of Kandahar. Two police officers were also killed in in Ghazni province
On Tuesday, Taliban suicide bombers and gunmen killed at least 41 people when they stormed a police training centre in the eastern city of Gardez
Also on Tuesday, at least 30 people died in car bombings in Ghazni
Afghanistan's army and police have suffered heavy casualties this year at the hands of the Taliban, a Sunni group who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country.

In one attack, a suicide bomber targeted worshippers in a Shia mosque in Kabul, police said on Friday.
A man â€œentered the mosque in Police District 13 of Kabul city â€¦ [and targeted] worshippers,â€ General Mohammad Salim Almas, Kabul crime branch chief, told AFP news agency, describing the attacker as a suicide bomber.
Major-General Alimast Momand, of Afghanistanâ€™s interior ministry, told the Associated Press news agency that the suicide bombing at the Imam Zaman Mosque in the cityâ€™s Dashti Barch area killed at least 30 people and wounded 45 more.
He said the attacker was on foot and walked into to the mosque where he detonated his explosives.
Najib Danish, an interior ministry spokesman,Â saidÂ â€œ39 people have been killed and 45 injured in the Kabul mosque attackâ€, but the numbers could not be independently confirmed.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group said in the statement that a suicide bomber had detonated a vest but did not provide evidence to support its claim.
Hazara community targeted
An Afghan government official told Reuters news agency that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.
Reports said the victims were members of the minority Hazara Shia community.
Mohammad Sabir Nassib,Â head of the local Isteqlal Hospital,Â said it received the bodies of two people slain in the attack as well as two wounded.
Fridayâ€™s second attack during prayers occurred at a Sunni mosque in the central province of Ghor.

Â 

Mohammad Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the provincial police, said at least 33 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local commander.
Initial reports had 10 dead in that attack.
The target was Abdul Ahed, a former militia commander andÂ Jamiat partyÂ leader who had sided with the government.
He was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat and the governor ofÂ Balkh province.

â€” TOLOnews (@TOLOnews) October 20, 2017

Among the dead were seven of Abdul Ahedâ€™s bodyguards.
Later on Friday, the Afghan president issued a statement condemning the two mosque attacks.
Ashraf Ghani said the incidents showed that â€œthe terrorists have once again staged bloody attacks, but they will not achieve their evil purposes and sow discord among the Afghansâ€.
Under pressure

 Jazeeraâ€™s Jennifer Glasse, reporting from Kabul, said: â€œWe have no idea who carried out the attack tonight in Kabul, but across Afghanistan this week, we have seen more than 130 people killed â€“ in the north, in the south, in the southwest, in the east â€“ mainly security forces killed by the Taliban.â€
She said Taliban fighters are escalating their attacks on security forces, â€œtrying to show the government they have some power here, trying to put pressure on a government that is trying to pressure them to come to the peace tableâ€.
Afghanistanâ€™s Shia population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on Shia mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a UN report released last week. 
Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.
The last attack in Kabul happened on September 29 as the faithful prepared to commemorate Ashoura, one of the holiest days in the Islamic calendar.
Responsibility for many of the attacks has been claimed by ISIL, also known as ISIS.

      Suicide attackers in Afghanistan killed nearly 60 people at two mosques Friday â€“ one in the Afghan capital of Kabul and the other in the central province of Ghor.
  

      At least 39 people died and 45 were wounded in an assault on a Shiite mosque in Kabul, Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said.
  

      The attacker detonated his suicide vest in Imam Zaman mosque in the early evening, police said.
  

      At least 20 people were killed and 10 were injured in an attack on a Sunni mosque in Ghor province, west of Kabul, Danish said.
  

      Abdulhai Khatebi, Ghor provincial spokesman, said the attacker detonated his suicide vest during worship services in the late afternoon. The mosque is in the provinceâ€™s Doleena district.

ISIS claims suicide attack at mosque in Afghan capital




      The US State Department condemned the attacks in a statement Friday, as well as others that took place in Afghanistan earlier in the week. 
  

      â€œIn the face of these senseless and cowardly acts, our commitment to Afghanistan is unwavering,â€ said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the State Department. â€œThe United States stands with the government and people of Afghanistan and will continue to support their efforts to achieve peace and security for their country.â€
  

      The two attacks are the latest in the country, where Afghan and coalition forces have been squaring off for years with Islamic militants, including the Taliban and ISIS â€“ both Sunni movements.
  

      Sectarian tensions have raged for some time between members of the Sunni and Shiite denominations of Islam. But there were  no immediate claims of responsibility for Fridayâ€™s attacks. ISIS has claimed responsibility this year for other attacks on Shiite mosques.

America's inevitable war is now an invisible one




The violence comes a day after Taliban militants stormed a base in Kandahar, in the south, and killed dozens of Afghan troops, the countryâ€™s Defense Ministry said.
  

      The ministry said 43 of the baseâ€™s 60 troops died in the attack. A further nine were injured, six are missing and two were not harmed. Ten attackers were killed in the assault.

      The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack, according to a statement from the groupâ€™s spokesman, Qhari Yosouf Ahmadi.
  

      Taliban raids on Afghan military installations arenâ€™t uncommon. In April, a deadly raid on a northern army base left as many as 140 feared dead. That attack was revenge for the deaths of two Taliban officials in the region, a spokesman for the group told CNN.

Death Toll From Kabul Mosque Attack Rises To 56

Afghan officials say suicide bombers have killed at least 89 people in two attacks on mosques in Afghanistan, as sectarian and terror-related violence continues to surge in the war-torn country.
The October 20 attacks targeted a Shi'ite mosque in the capital, Kabul, and a Sunni mosque in the central Afghan province of Ghor.
An Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman said that the death toll in the Kabul attack had risen to at least 56 people.
At least 55 people were also injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up as worshippers were gathering for prayers at the Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi section of the capital.
The extremist group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in Kabul.
The attacks come one day after 43 soldiers were killed and nine wounded in a Taliban attack on an army camp in the southern province of Kandahar.
In the second attack, officials said at least 33 people were killed and 10 injured when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in Khewiagan, a Sunni mosque in the district of Dulaina in central Ghor Province. 
A local official said an anti-Taliban commander inside the mosque at the time may have been the target of the attack. No claim of responsibility has been made for the attack.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said the attacks show that ""the terrorists have once again staged bloody attacks, but they will not achieve their evil purposes and sow discord among the Afghans.""
The United States strongly condemned the October 20 attacks and previous attacks in Afghanistan during a week in which U.S. drones strikes were reported to have killed more than 30 militants in the region.
""In the face of these senseless and cowardly acts, our commitment to Afghanistan is unwavering,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
""The United States stands with the government and people of Afghanistan and will continue to support their efforts to achieve peace and security for their country,"" she said.
Afghanistan's minority Shi'ite population has been the target of several terror attacks this year that have been blamed on the Taliban and IS.
A previous attack on a Shi'ite mosque in Kabul occurred on September 29 as Muslims prepared to commemorate Ashura, one of the holiest days in the Islamic calendar. Six people were killed in that attack.
A recent United Nations report said at least 84 people had been killed and 194 wounded so far in 2017 in attacks on Shiâ€™ite mosques and religious ceremonies prior to the most recent incidents.
About 90 percent of the Afghan population is Sunni Muslim.

ISLAMABAD â€”Â 
Suicide bombers struck two mosques in Afghanistan Friday, killing at least 72 people.
At a Shiâ€™ite mosque in Afghanistanâ€™s capital, at least 39 people died and at least 41 were injured. Women and children were among the victims.
â€œThis is absolute barbarism,â€ said Ibrahim, a man who rushed to the mosque after the blast.
Security officials told VOA the bomber walked into the Imam Zaman Mosque Friday evening in the western Dashti Barch area of Kabul and blew himself up.
â€œIt was one suicide bomber packed with explosives and hand grenades wrapped around his body,â€ an eyewitness told AFP.
A pro-Islamic State website reported its loyalists claimed responsibility for the Kabul attack. The Afghan branch of the Islamic State terrorist group has taken credit for recent bombings of Shiâ€™ite worship places in Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan.
Second suicide attack
A second suicide Friday blast hit a Sunni mosque in the central Afghan province of Ghor, killing at least 33 worshipers, including one local leader who was the apparent target of the explosion.
A pro-government former Afghan jihadi commander was offering prayers along with his supporters when the bomber stormed the mosque. No one claimed responsibility for that attack.
Early Saturday, militants fired two rockets at NATOâ€™s headquarters in downtown Kabul. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the incident that underlines the worsening security in the country.
Week of deadly attacks
Nearly 200 people, mostly security forces, have been killed in separate militant attacks across Afghanistan this week, making it one of the deadliest in recent months.
They include a Taliban bomb-and-gun attack in the province of Kandahar that killed at least 43 Afghan soldiers on Thursday. The insurgent assault almost wiped out the Afghan National Army base in the district of Maiwand.
On Tuesday, a twin suicide car bombing of the police headquarters in eastern Paktia province killed at least 60 people and wounded 300. The provincial police chief was among the dead.A separate attack the same day in the nearby Ghazni province left at least 20 people dead.

KABUL, Afghanistan â€” Nearly 60 people were killed when suicide bombers blew themselves up in two separate mosque attacks in Afghanistan on Friday, officials said, capping a bloody week in the war-torn country.
In the first attack, on a Shiite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, at least 39 people including women and children were killed and 45 others wounded when a suicide bomber exploded as worshippers gathered for evening prayer.
â€œUnfortunately this evening a suicide bomber detonated himself among the worshippers inside a mosque in Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood of Kabul city,â€ Kabul police spokesman Abdul Basir Mujahid told AFP.

Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish confirmed the latest attack toll on Twitter.
â€œI was in the mosque bathroom when I heard a blast. I rushed inside the mosque and saw all the worshippers covered in blood,â€ Hussain Ali told AFP.

â€œSome of the wounded were fleeing. I tried to stop someone to help me help the wounded but everyone was in a panic. It took ambulances and the police about an hour to reach the area.â€
Police initially said a gunman entered the Imam Zaman mosque in a heavily Shiite neighborhood in the west of the city and opened fire on worshippers.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the grisly attack but recent assaults on Shiite mosques in Afghanistan have been carried out by Islamic State militants, who belong to the rival Sunni branch of Islam.

In the second assault, a suicide bomber detonated himself in a Sunni mosque in the impoverished and remote central province of Ghor, killing at least 20 and wounding 10, Danish said.
A senior local police commander, who is believed to have been the target of the attack in Dolaina district, was among the dead, district governor Mohsen Danishyar told AFP.
Danishyar put the death toll as high as 30.
The attacks cap one of the bloodiest weeks in Afghanistan in recent memory, with more than 120 people killed and hundreds more wounded in four separate Taliban attacks on police and military bases.
In three of the attacks Taliban militants used bomb-laden Humvees stolen from Afghan government forces to blast their way into targets, as militants step up direct attacks on security installations.
The last attack on a Shiite mosque in Kabul happened on September 29 as Muslims prepared to commemorate Ashura, one of the holiest days in the Islamic calendar.

Six people were killed when a suicide bomber posing as a shepherd blew himself up near Hussainia mosque, one of the biggest Shiite centers in the city, as worshippers gathered for Friday prayers.
An attack on another Shiite mosque in the city on August 25 killed 28 people and wounded around 50 others.
Four attackers who set off explosions and fired gunshots laid siege to the mosque in the north of the capital for four hours as dozens of men, women and children had gathered for Friday prayers.
In recent years, the Taliban and Islamic State jihadists have repeatedly targeted the minority Shiite community, who number around three million in overwhelmingly Sunni Afghanistan.

","An explosion took place in the western parts of Kabul city later this afternoon leaving several people dead or wounded, according to the security officials.

The incident took place in the vicinity of the 6th police district of the city in Sar-e-Kariz Bazaar located close to the residence of the second deputy chief executive of the unity government.

According the security officials, at least two people were killed and eight others were wounded in the explosion which was likely triggered due to an incident setting the gas cylinders on fire.

However, another security official in the 6th police district said at least seven people were killed and nine others were wounded.

The main cause of the explosion has not been ascertained so far but the ministry of interior had earlier said the blast has likely taken place due to malfunction in one of the gas cylinders and at least eight people were wounded in the explosion.

However, the eyewitnesses in the area had said the blast was likely triggered due to a magnetic bomb that set the vehicle carrying gas cylinders on fire.

Today’s incident took place amid ongoing efforts by the anti-government armed militant groups to carry out attacks in the key cities of the country including Kabul.

However, it is yet not clear if the militants had any links with today’s incident or not.",https://www.khaama.com/explosion-in-kabul-city-inflicts-casualties-04004/

","A suicide bomber detonated his explosives at the gate of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) in Darulaman in PD 6 of Kabul city killing seven people and wounded 13 others, officials have confirmed.

The explosion took place shortly after 4.30pm on Sunday afternoon.

The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development's spokesman Faridoon Azhand told TOLOnews that the explosion happened outside the gate when ministry staff were leaving work for the day.

However eyewitnesses said it appeared that the suicide bomber might have targeted a vehicle carrying foreigners who were leaving the ministry. 

Kabul police also said the suicide attacker probably wanted to target a vehicle of foreigners leaving the ministry, but they were not harmed.

Officials also said that at least another six people were wounded in the attack.

Residents in the area took to social media immediately after the blast and said the explosion had been fairly big.

This is the second time in just over a month that this ministry had been targeted.

On June 11, at least 17 people were killed, and 40 wounded - also in a suicide bombing.

The suicide bomber in this attack also targeted ministry staff when they were leaving work for the day.

ISLAMABAD â€”Â 
Afghan officials say more than 40 people have been killed and 84 others wounded in a suicide attack on a building in Kabul that houses a Shi'ite Muslim cultural center with ties to Iran.

A spokesman for Afghan Ministry of Public Health told reporters that four women and two children were among those killed in the blast.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. An online statement said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber, and that three other bombs were also used. Previous attacks on Shi'ite worship places and processions in Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan were also claimed by Islamic State.
The bomber, witnesses reported, blew himself up near a big meeting in the basement of the Tebyan Social and Cultural Center building shortly before other devices went off.








A distraught man is carried away following a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, Dec. 28, 2017. Authorities say attackers stormed the Shiite Muslim cultural center in the Afghan capital Kabul, setting off multiple bombs and killing dozens.



Responding to criticism over a lack of security around the building, Afghan officials said the cultural center did not inform police prior to holding Thursday's event.

The offices of the Afghan Voice Agency (AVA), a news organization, are near the cultural center. Reuters reports that at least one AVA journalist is among those killed.
Reaction
President  
The presidential palace said in a statement the Afghan government is committed to eliminating terrorism.
""Terrorists groups and their backers must know that the Afghan people are united and stand firm to any plot carried out by their enemies; these heinous attacks will not break the resolve of the Afghan people,"" the statement read.
The White House issued a statement Thursday that condemned the attack and offered ""its deepest condolences to the victims and their families.""
""The United States stands firmly with the government and people of Afghanistan and will work closely with the National Unity Government to bring the perpetrators of this heinous attack to justice. The enemies of Afghanistan will not succeed in their attempts to destroy the country and divide the Afghan people, who are resilient and committed to establishing peace and stability,"" the statement said.
NATO's Resolute Support mission in a statement condemned the bloodshed.
""Cultural advancement and freedom of speech will not be deterred. Our mutual enemies must know they will not win and the Afghan people will not be silenced,"" said the mission, which comprises mostly American troops.
The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan called the attack ""another truly despicable crime in a year already marked by unspeakable atrocities.""
The Taliban insurgency distanced itself from the attack, saying its fighters do not target civilian facilities, especially those housing education and cultural centers.
Overnight blast
Meanwhile, an overnight bomb blast in the northern province of Balkh killed at least six children. The incident took place in the district of Dawlatabad. Officials reported the victims found an improvised explosive device planted by anti-government militants, and were playing with it when it exploded.

The explosion early on Thursday struck an area close to the Afghan Voice news agency and Tebyan cultural centre, local media reported.
People gathered at Tebyan were marking theÂ 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan.
Women and children were among those killed. The majority of victims were visitors to the centre.
â€œA suicide bomber detonated explosives near a cultural house belonging to Shia Afghans,â€ said Al Jazeeraâ€™s Abdullah Shahood, reporting from Kabul. â€œPeople in critical condition are being taken to hospital where there are chaotic scenes.
â€œAfghans are rushing to hospitals to donate blood.â€
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack on its Amaq website, but provided no evidence of its claim.
Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, called the attack a â€œcrime against humanityâ€.
In a statement, he said: â€œThe terrorists have attacked our mosques, our holy places and now our cultural centre.â€
Mushtaq Rahim, a regional security expert, told Al Jazeera from Kabul that there were several members of the Afghan Shia community in the area.
â€œThey [Afghan Shia] have been targeted in Afghanistan throughout 2017,â€ he said.
The fact a media outlet was among the targets was also important, Rahim said, because ISIL was seeking more coverage.
â€œPreviously, they [ISIL] have attacked religious gatherings,â€ he told Al Jazeera. â€œThe media has not provided them with the coverage they desire.â€
ISIL, which has a presence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, regularly targets Shia Muslims.

Images posted to social media showed the aftermath of the blast, with the neighbouring Afghan Voice office ripped apart by the force of the explosion.Â 
Other photos showed pictures of dead bodies strewn across the ground in an outside area.
Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AJSC) condemned the attack â€œin the strongest terms possibleâ€, writing on Twitter.Â 
The group said it was heading to the scene to assist the aid efforts.
String of attacks
Amnesty Internationalâ€™s South Asia director Biraj Patnaik said Thursdayâ€™s attack was a reminder of the countryâ€™s security woes.Â 
â€œThis gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians. In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups,â€ he said.
â€œWith the Afghan capital hit once again, no one can credibly claim that Kabul safe. The European governments who insist on this dangerous fiction by forcibly returning Afghans are putting their lives in danger.â€
AJSC recently reported a surge in attacks against journalists, with at least 73 cases recorded in 2017, an increase of 35 percent compared with 2016.
In May, ISIL claimed an attack targetting an Afghan state television building in Jalalabad that killed six people.
In November, at least one security guard was killed as ISIL fighters stormed Shamshad TV, a private television station.
Earlier, in January 2016, after threats from the Taliban, a minibus carrying TOLOnews employees was bombed, killing seven people during the evening rush hour.

More broadly, the Afghan capital has come under attack several times in 2017.Â 
On March 8, more than 30 people were killed when gunmen dressed in white lab coatsÂ stormed a hospitalÂ in the centre of the city. ISIL claimed responsibility for that attack, butÂ officials consideredÂ other groups could have been responsible.Â 
On May 31, aÂ truck bomb explodedÂ near the diplomatic district, killing more than 150 people. It remains unclear who was behind the assault.
On October 21, ISIL claimed responsibility forÂ killing at least 39 peopleÂ at a Shia mosque in Kabul.

More than 40 people were killed and dozens of others wounded on Thursday in a series of explosions that targeted a Shiite cultural center in the Afghan capital of Kabul, Afghan officials said.
The deadly assault began this morning when a suicide bomber set off an explosive vest at the Tebyan cultural center, Sadiq Muradi, Kabulâ€™s deputy police chief, said, according to The New York Times.
Several witnesses have told media oulets that people had gathered for a morning panel discussion on the anniversary of the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan. Officials said two other nearby devices were detonated after the initial explosion.
Islamic State militants have since claimed responsibility for this morningâ€™s attacks.

Of the people killed, four were women and two children, said Waheed Majrooh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health. At least 84 others were wounded, most of them being treated for burns. Officials said most of the casualties appeared to have come from the first explosion.
As Reuters pointed out, the Islamic State in Khorasan, the local ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, has said itâ€™s been behind several attacks against Shiites in the country.
The United Nations has documented a growing number of sectarian attacks on Shiite targets since January 2016, killing more than 250 Shiites. In October, ISIS claimed responsibility for twin attacks on Shiite mosques in Afghanistan that killed nearly 60 people.

The death toll rose over the day as hospitals struggled to cope, and may climb further.â€œThe hall was packed with the people when there was a blast at the back,â€ said Ali Abbas Qul, a university student who had attended the lecture. He wept outside a hospital, in clothes still stained with the blood of two friends.â€œPeople started running everywhere. Many lost consciousness. I lost my two friends and picked up their bodies. Many of the university students are still missing.â€Two more blasts outside the building targeted security and medical services, and people attempting to put out a fire started by the first bomb.â€œI was trying to help people who were injured and killed in the first two blasts when the third explosion hit,â€ said Saed Qasem Rahmati, 35, a former employee at the cultural centre who rushed to help after the first bomb and was still in shock.Many of the victims were badly burned, he said, and he feared that several friends might be among the unidentifiable bodies.Kabul mapThe explosions killed at least one journalist working for the Afghan Voice news agency, whose offices were on the floor above the cultural centre.Ali Reza Ahmadi said he had leapt from his second-floor office after seeing flames coming from the building. â€œI jumped from the roof towards the basement, yelling at people to get water to put out the fire,â€ he told the AP.Isisâ€™s Amaaq news agency said the cultural centre had been targeted by Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), the full name of the groupâ€™s Afghan affiliate, because it was funded by Iran and used to spread Shia beliefs.It was the latest sectarian attack in a capital that had once been relatively immune to such violence. For all the civilian deaths in Kabul over four decades of civil war, until the rise of Isis very few could be chalked up to the Sunni-Shia tensions that have claimed so many lives from Iraq to Pakistan.Now a group with a strong sectarian agenda appears to have outstripped the home-grown Taliban in inflicting violence on Kabul.â€œ[This is ISKPâ€™s] 7th suicide bombing in the capital since 20 Oct, killing 130 people in total, making ISKP a larger threat in Kabul than Taliban for this period, at least,â€ Borhan Osman, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group, tweeted.The shift in attack rates from the group that has led the insurgency for nearly two decades to Isis, which is relatively new, was once â€œunimaginableâ€, Osman said.The trend is worrying because very little is known about Isis operations in Kabul, Osman warned. Fighters in Afghanistanâ€™s east, where Osama bin Laden once hid in the Tora Bora caves, have received far more press and military attention. â€œWith [the] focus on Nangarhar, we know little about ISKP Kabul cell,â€ Osman wrote.Police officers keep watch after the explosions in Kabul. Photograph: Shah Marai/AFP/Getty ImagesA senior Isis commander, speaking to the Guardian from an undisclosed location, said the group aimed to replace the Taliban, and would continue with its policy of sectarian attacks.â€œIsis is continuously recruiting Taliban commanders and fighters, and deliberately challenging the Talibanâ€™s dominance,â€ he said. â€œThe Taliban in the past have negotiated with the US and the government in Kabul, diverting from the jihad. What they are doing is not Islamic jihad.â€In November the United Nations warned of a new trend of attacks on Shia Muslims and places of worship that began in 2016. Mostly claimed by Isis, together they have killed or injured hundreds of people.â€œBeginning in 2016, a pattern of attacks against Shia worshippers emerged, mainly claimed by Islamic State Khorasan Province,â€ the UN said. Prior to that, the only major sectarian attack documented by the UN was a bombing at a religious festival in 2011, claimed by the Pakistani militant group Laskhar-e-Jhangvi.The UN said many children were likely to be among those killed in Thursdayâ€™s bombing because families had gathered at the centre to mark the national day.â€œI have little doubt that this attack deliberately targeted civilians,â€ said Toby Lanzer, the acting head of the mission in Afghanistan. â€œToday in Kabul we have witnessed another truly despicable crime in a year already marked by unspeakable atrocities.â€",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/28/blast-afghan-news-agency-kabul-kills-dozens

The attack occurred at a Shiite cultural center located in the same building as the agency while a panel discussion on the 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was being held there, the spokesman, Nasrat Rahimi, said.

Two other smaller bombs also went off at the center, though it is not clear whether they claimed any casualties.
The Sunni extremist group ""Islamic State"" (IS) has claimed responsibility for the attack in an online statement posted by its propaganda outletÂ Amaq. The agency, however, offered no evidence for its claim.
In its statement, Amaq alleged that the center was funded by Iran and propagated Shiite beliefs.

The attacks come days after another suicide bomber killed six civilians near an intelligence agency compound in theÂ city.
Worsening security
A spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani described the attack in a statement as an ""unpardonable"" crime against humanity and Islam.
The security situation in Kabul has deteriorated rapidly over the past few months amid increasing attacks both by the Taliban and IS, which is seeking to increase its foothold in the country.
The western area of Kabul in which the attacks took place is a predominantly Shiite neighborhood that has been the target of IS militants in the past.

FRANCE 24","At least 40 people were killed and dozens more wounded in multiple blasts at a Shiite cultural centre in Kabul on Thursday, officials said, in the latest deadly violence to hit the Afghan capital.The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the assault near the Afghan Voice Agency, a media outlet which earlier reports had suggested could have been the target.

Deputy interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi told AFP the blasts were in fact aimed at the Shiite Tabayan cultural centre.

""A ceremony was being held to mark the 38th anniversary of Soviet invasion in Afghanistan when the explosion went off,"" he said.

""We have 40 killed, 30 wounded, but this is not the final toll. It might go up.""

Rahimi said the main blast was followed by two smaller bomb explosions that did not cause casualties.

Kabul has become one of the deadliest places in war-torn Afghanistan for civilians in recent months, as the Taliban step up their attacks and the IS group seeks to expand its presence in the country.

Thursday's assault comes days after a suicide bomber killed six civilians in an attack near an Afghan intelligence agency compound in the city, which was claimed by the IS group.

The Middle Eastern jihadist group has gained ground in Afghanistan since it first appeared in the region in 2015 and has scaled up its attacks in Kabul, including on security installations and the country's Shiite minority.

The group's propaganda outlet Amaq said Thursday's attack was carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest.

Amaq offered no evidence for its claim of responsibility.

Security ramped up

A Kabul hospital official told local TV that 18 wounded had been brought to his facility.

""Five of the wounded are in critical condition and our doctors are working to save their lives,"" Sabir Nasib, head of Istiqlal hospital, said.

A man attending the anniversary ceremony said he heard a ""big boom"".

""We do not know the numbers (of casualties). When the explosion happened we immediately fled,"" he told Tolo News.

Mohammad Hasan Rezayee, a university student also at the ceremony, told Tolo News he had suffered burns to his face in the blast.

""After the blast there was fire and smoke inside the building and everyone was pleading for help,"" he said.

Security in the city has been ramped up since May 31 when a massive truck bomb ripped through the diplomatic quarter, killing some 150 people and wounding around 400 others -- mostly civilians.

Afghan media has previously been targeted by militants, underlying the risks faced by journalists in the war-torn country.

Suicide Car-Bomb Attack Kills At Least Three In Kabul

","
Afghan officials say at least three people have been killed and two others wounded in a suicide car-bomb attack that apparently targeted a foreign security company in Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast that hit the Despechari area in the east of the Afghan capital in the morning of March 17.
Deputy Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said the attacker ""detonated himself before reaching the target.""
The ministry said all those killed and wounded in the attack were civilians, with no casualties among the contractors.
Eyewitnesses confirmed that the victims were passersby and local workers.
â€œAll those killed were barbers or shoeshine men. I was horrified when I saw their bodies,"" eyewitness Mohammad Osman told Reuters. The explosion damaged nearby buildings, he added. 
Kabul has recently seen a spate of militant attacks claimed by the Taliban and Islamic State group. 
Earlier this week, top U.S. commander in Afghanistan John Nicholson said security in the capital would be ""the main effort"" for international powers helping Afghan defense and security forces.
As part of its new regional strategy announced in August, Washington has stepped up assistance to the Afghan military in a bid to break the stalemate in the more than 16-year Afghan war and force the militants to the negotiating table.
Last month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered to allow the Taliban to establish itself as a political party and said he would work to remove sanctions on the militant group, among other incentives, if it joined the government in peace negotiations.
In return, the militants would have to recognize the Kabul government and respect the rule of law.
But the Taliban has so far ruled out direct talks with Kabul and insisted it would only negotiate with the United States, which it calls a ""foreign occupying force."" The Taliban also says that NATO forces must withdraw before negotiations can begin.
The United States has refused to withdraw troops and insisted that the Afghan government must play a lead role in peace negotiations.

At least three civilians were killed and two others wounded, with no casualties among the security contractors, when the bomb exploded in Kabulâ€™s Police District Nine, interior ministry spokesperson Najid Danish told Al Jazeera.
The Taliban immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred during Saturday morning rush hour.
The attack comes days afterÂ General John Nicholson, the top US commander in Afghanistan, said that the security of the country would be â€œthe main effortâ€ for international forces helping Afghan security forces.

The Taliban and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group have launched a series of deadly attacks across the country, killing at least 200 people in Kabul alone since the beginning of 2018, according to an Al Jazeera tally.
President Ashraf Ghani called for a ceasefire last month and also explored a possibility of the Taliban group becoming a political party, if they accept the peace deal unconditionally.
There was no official response from the Taliban to Ghaniâ€™s invitation to talks. The Taliban, however, invitedÂ USÂ officials to its political office in Qatar to discuss a â€œpeaceful solutionâ€ to end the bloodshed inÂ Afghanistan.
The group also said that departure of American troops from Afghanistan remains a precondition for the groupâ€™s talks offer.
But James Mattis, the US defence secretary, said on Tuesday during an unannounced visit to Kabul that the elements of the Taliban are open to talks with the Afghan government.
In December, General John W Nicholson Jr of the US Army said his country would deploy more troops in an advisory role to Afghan forces in 2018, on top of the 14,000 American soldiers already stationed in the country.

KABUL â€” A Taliban car bomb killed at least three people and wounded two in the Afghan capital Kabul on Saturday in an apparent attack on a foreign contractor company that came despite a further tightening in security across the city, officials said.Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said all those killed and wounded in the explosion were civilians, with no casualties among the contractors.Witnesses said the true casualty toll was higher and that, like countless other attacks in Kabul, its main victims appeared to be ordinary people going about their daily lives.""All those killed were barbers or shoeshine men. I was horrified when I saw their bodies,"" said Mohammad Osman, who was nearby when the explosion shattered buildings and said he had seen four or five bodies on the ground.A Taliban statement claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said targeted ""foreign invaders"". It said the attack destroyed two foreign vehicles and killed between six and 10 people, but it denied any Afghan civilians were killed.""More such attacks will be carried out,"" the statement said.While the latest blast was not on the scale of others that have killed scores of people recently, the constant stream of attacks in Kabul has undermined confidence in the Western-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani.Earlier this week, General John Nicholson, the top US commander in Afghanistan, said security in Kabul would be ""the main effort"" for international powers helping Afghan defence and security forces.The extra security in Kabul has turned the city centre into a fortified zone of high concrete blast walls, barbed wire and police checkpoints and security forces say they have intercepted numerous attacks before they take place.However, Saturday's incident underlined the fact that insurgent groups are still able to evade checks and carry out attacks in the city streets.Ghani has offered peace talks with the Taliban, who have been fighting to drive out foreign forces and re-establish their version of strict Islamic law to Afghanistan, but the movement has so far shown no sign of accepting the offer.

ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN â€”Â 
Afghan officials say a suicide blast has killed at least 31 people and wounded more than 65 others in Kabul.

Officials and witnesses say the bomber targeted a crowd during celebrations to mark the Persian new year, Nowruz, Wednesday near a Shi'ite Muslim neighborhood.

Islamic State claimed responsibility, according to the SITE Intelligence Group that monitors global jihadist threats. The terrorist group identified the bomber as a Pakistani man, saying he detonated his suicide vest amidst the gathering in the Kart-e-Sakhi area.

An Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman, Nasrat Rahimi, told VOA those killed and wounded were all civilians.

Police and rescue workers say the death toll could rise.

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the terrorist attack as ""a crime against humanity,"" saying such acts will not deter Afghans from celebrating their national and religious events and undertaking developmental activities.

General John Nicholson, who commands U.S. and NATO's Resolute Support mission in the country, denounced the attack.

""The latest attack by the enemies of the people of Afghanistan once again shows their savagery and inhumanity.It was an indiscriminate attack on innocent civilians,"" Nicholson said.

In recent months, IS terrorists have frequently targeted Shi'ite places of worship and gatherings in the capital city and elsewhere in Afghanistan.

The most recent IS-plotted attack took place March 9 when a suicide bomber struck a Shi'ite mosque, killing 10 people.

Afghan authorities have lately tightened security across the city and intelligence officials have claimed to have arrested IS operatives and uncovered the group's cells.

Despite the success, the government is under fire for not preventing insurgents and terrorists from carrying out deadly attacks in Kabul.

General Nicholson disclosed last week that Afghan forces have launched a campaign to clear militant ""safe houses"" and ""facilitation networks"" from sections of Kabul.

He said intelligence-driven raids as well as ""house-to-house"" searches in about 18 districts inside the city are ongoing. The general added Afghan intelligence operatives, together with U.S. special forces, have successfully identified and taken out a number of militant-linked locations.

Nicholson, however, acknowledged the security campaign faces ""a big challenge"" in a city of more than five million people that has grown in a ""very haphazard"" way during the past 10 years. He also noted a large amount of criminal activity in the city.

""Often we find criminal networks that helped enable the activities of terrorists,"" he said, adding, ""So, we are dealing with a pretty significant problem inside the city to clean it up.""

The shrine has been attacked before. At least 14 people were killed in October 2016 as Shia Muslims prepared for a religious day of mourning during the festival of Ashura. A bombing in 2011 killed at least 59.

      A suicide bomber killed 29 people Wednesday in Kabul, the latest in a string of attacks to rock the Afghan capital since the start of the year.
  

      Another 52 people were injured in the blast, according to Ministry of Public Health spokesman Wahid Majroh.
  

      A spokesman for Kabul city police, Basir Mojahid, said the attacker was trying to reach the capitalâ€™s Sakhi shrine, where people had gathered to celebrate the Persian new year, known as Nowruz.

      Before reaching the shrine, the attacker was identified by security forces and blew himself up in front of Kabul University, Mojahid said. The blast happened about 12:40 p.m. local time (4 a.m. ET).
  

      ISIS claimed responsibility for the blast in a statement, saying an attacker it named as Abu Talha al-Peshawri had detonated his explosive vest among â€œpolytheistsâ€ gathering to celebrate Nowruz.
  

      The US Ambassador to Afghanistan, John R. Bass, condemned the attack as â€œshamefulâ€ on his official Twitter account and said the United States was committed to working with the Afghan authorities â€œto secure peace in the year ahead.â€
  


I condemn the shameful attack in #Kabul today, at the beginning of the new year, and reiterate the United States' commitment to working with our #Afghan partners to secure peace in the year ahead.â€” ChargÃ© dâ€™Affaires Karen Decker (@USAmbKabul) March 21, 2018




      A series of attacks in the capital this year had already fueled doubts over the Afghan authoritiesâ€™ ability to keep people safe.
  

      Less then two weeks ago, a suicide bomber killed at least nine people when he detonated his device at a security checkpoint. 
  

      The previous month, several people were killed and injured in a suicide attack in the Shashdarak area of Kabul, not far from the Kabul Green Zone where many diplomatic compounds are located.
  

In January, Taliban gunmen stormed the Intercontinental hotel in Kabul, killing 22 people. Days later, the group claimed responsibility for an attack outside a hospital in which militants detonated explosives packed inside an ambulance. Nearly 100 people were killed in that attack.
  

      The Afghan government announced on February 28 it would be willing to recognize the Taliban as a legitimate political party as part of a potential ceasefire agreement with the Islamist militant group.
  

      The group has not publicly responded to the proposal.
  

      During a trip to Kabul last week, US Defense Secretary James Mattis said that some factions of the Taliban had expressed interested in pursuing peace talks with the Afghan government.

Dozens Killed In New Year Attack In Kabul

","
Afghan officials say a suicide attack outside a Shi'ite mosque in Kabul killed at least 29 people and wounded dozens, as people in the capital celebrated the new year holiday Norouz. .
""Unfortunately, 29 Afghan citizens lost their lives and 52 others were wounded in this incident,"" Health Ministry Wahidullah Majrooh told RFE/RL.
Nusrat Rahimi, a deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry, told RFE/RL that most of the victims of the attack claimed by the extremist group Islamic State (IS) were civilians.
The bomber was spotted by police as he attempted to enter a large gathering for the Norouz celebration in Kabul's Kart-e Sakhi mosque, Mohammad Salem Almas, head of criminal investigations in the Kabul police, told RFE/RL.
The attacker detonated the explosives that he was carrying before entering the mosque, Almas said.
Kabul police chief Daud Amin said the attacker managed to slip past a checkpoint on his way to the mosque.
""We have taken security measures in the wider area and specifically around the Kart-e Sakhi mosque,"" Amin said. ""Unfortunately, the suicide attacker passed through the first checkpoint.""
â€œWe are investigating how he did that. We have ordered all personnel at the checkpoint to be taken in for questioning,â€ he added.
IS claimed responsibility for the attack via its propaganda arm Amaq, the SITE Intelligence Group said.
""The martyrdom operation carried out with a suicide vest struck a Shi'ite gathering during their Norouz holiday celebrations in the city of Kabul,"" Amaq said.
UN envoy to Afghanistan Tadamichi Yamamoto issued a statement condemning the ""egregious"" attack."" 
""Those who have organized and enabled this attack must be brought to justice and held to account, Yamamoto said in his statement. 
""On behalf of the United Nations in Afghanistan, I express our deep condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery of the injured."" 








A sandal is seen lying on the ground along a road at the site of a suicide bombing in Kabul on March 21.




The blast, the latest in a series to have hit Shi'ite targets in the capital, came as people were walking away from the mosque, near the city's main university.
The Kart-e Sakhi mosque was a target of previous militant attacks.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Taliban and Islamic State (IS) militants have increasingly targeted Kabul in recent months. IS militants view members of the Shi'ite minority as apostates.
Norouz is a national holiday, widely celebrated in Afghanistan, but has also faced opposition from some fundamentalist Muslims, who say it is un-Islamic. 
Afghan officials fear that the death toll from the attack may rise.
The latest explosion to hit Kabul highlighted the threat to the city despite government promises to tighten security following a series of brazen militant attacks in Kabul.
Almost 100 people were killed in January in Kabul in a Taliban suicide attack in a secure zone home to government offices and foreign embassies.
Also in January, Taliban militants killed 22 people in a luxury Kabul hotel.

The blasts went off during rush hour on Monday morning in the Shash Darak area of the Afghan capital.
Al Jazeeraâ€™s Jennifer Glasse, reporting from Kabul, said the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group claimed responsibility for the attack.
In the first explosion, a motorcycle-riding attacker detonated himself close to the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the main Afghan intelligence agency, TOLOnews quoted an interior ministry spokesman as saying.
In the explosion that followed about half an hour later, a second suicide bomber targeted emergency medical workers and journalists who had arrived near the scene of the first blast.
Al Jazeeraâ€™s Glasse said the second suicide bomber was posing as a journalist.Â 
The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee reported that nine journalists who rushed to cover the aftermath of the first explosion were killed in the second blast.Â 
A spokesperson for the Afghan health ministry said the two attacks killed at least 29 people and wounded 49 others, according to TOLOnews.Â 
TOLOnews also reported that its cameraman, Yar Mohammad Tokhi, who had worked for the company for 12 years, was among those who were killed in the attack.Â 
Meanwhile, AFP news agency reported that its chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, was also killed.Â

An Al Jazeera photographer, Seyyed Nasser Hashemi, was also hurt in the incident. He is currently in the hospital recovering from his injuries, Al Jazeeraâ€™s Glasse said. Â 
TOLOnews also reported that two other journalists were wounded in the second blast.
The death of the nine journalists is considered as the worst attack on Afghan media in modern history, Glasse said.Â 
â€œItâ€™s a very grim morning here,â€ she said describing the situation in the Afghan capital.

She added that there are many fortified streets near the site of the attack.
â€œThereâ€™s a lot of security in that area â€“ itâ€™s not far from NATO headquarters â€“ and security has been beefed up around the Afghan capital, but clearly they havenâ€™t been able to stop these kinds of attacks.â€
The explosions on Monday come just a week after a blast hit a voter registration centre in Kabul, killing at least 57 people and wounding more than 100 others.
Separately, at least 11 Afghan schoolchildren were killed in Kandahar province on Monday when a suicide car bomber hit a convoy of Romanian troops patrolling the area as part of the NATO force.Â 
Attacks have multiplied in recent days in advance of the long-delayed parliamentary and district council electionsÂ scheduled for October 20 this year.
â€œThe series of attacks here in Kabul have made the Afghan capital most dangerous place in Afghanistan to be,â€ Al Jazeeraâ€™s Glasse said.

Updated at 7:50 a.m. ET Coordinated suicide bomb attacks near the Afghan intelligence agency building in Kabul have killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens more, including several journalists. In a separate attack in the southern city of Kandahar, 11 schoolchildren were killed and 16 hurt when a suicide bomber in a truck targeted NATO-led forces. In Kabul, the first explosion occurred when a suicide bomber riding a motorbike detonated outside the headquarters of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security. When reporters rushed to the scene to cover that explosion, a second suicide bomber on foot struck, suggesting that journalists may have been among the intended targets. If so, the deaths of at least eight reporters in the twin attacks is one of the worst attacks against journalists in Afghanistan's decades-long conflict, Najib Sharifi, director of the Afghan Journalist Safety Committee, said.

Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai confirmed the casualty figures and said that four policemen were also among the dead. 




 
The Two-Way 
Kabul Bombing Kills At Least 6; ISIS Claims Responsibility






Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack via its news agency. The group said it was targeting the intelligence headquarters. In Kandahar, a suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden van into a foreign-force convoy, police said, according to Reuters. The 11 children killed were students at a nearby madrassa, or religious school, says Matiullah Zhman, a spokesman for Kandahar police quoted by Reuters. There was no immediate claim of responsibility in that attack. A spokesman for Resolute Support, a NATO-led training mission for Afghan forces, says eight Romanian soldiers attached to the unit were also wounded in the attack. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those wounded, and with the innocent Afghans whose lives were needlessly taken from them by the enemies of Afghanistan,"" Gen. John Nicholson, Resolute Support commander, said in a statement.   ""In their spring offensive announcement, the Taliban claimed they would pay special attention to protecting the lives and properties of the Afghan people; however, their hypocrisy was on full display today as they viciously killed Afghan citizens, including children who were Madrassa students,"" he said.   In the Kabul attacks, Shah Marai, a photographer for Agence France Press (AFP), was among those killed. Sharifi, the director of the journalist group, said at least seven of journalists lost their lives. 


Images from the scene showed men lying on the ground, their cameras flung amid pools of blood. Following the attack, colleagues of the slain and wounded reporters posted images of their friends on social media. ""I was at the hospital where the dead bodies of at least four journalists were kept â€“ a large group of journalists [gathered] there to mourn,"" said Sharifi. ""Everybody was heart broken, everybody was crying, everybody was sharing tears."" Another Afghan journalist, Anees Ur Rehman, said he was speechless. ""Sorry, I don't have any words to express my feelings,"" he said. Journalists in Afghanistan, he said, were ""family."" Ur Rehman said other reporters on the scene described the second bomber as being disguised as a journalist. ""They adopt behaviour of journalist,"" he said. He said his friends â€“ fellow reporters â€“ told him the explosives were concealed inside a video camera. ""This is a very big threat,"" he said. They are adopting ""new things"" â€“ new methods â€” of killing people, he said. Sharifi said he had heard a similar claim, but could not confirm it. Afghanistan is one of the world's deadliest countries for journalists â€“ but it also enjoys a vibrant, critical press. Sharifi described Afghanistan's press freedom as ""one of the biggest achievements of the government."" ""It will definitely [meant to] push them away from covering such incidents, and [to] compel journalists to stop practicing journalism,"" he said. ""I really admire the courage,"" he said. ""Despite all odds they have continued following this difficult journey."" Earlier this month, a suicide bombing at a voter registration center in Kabul killed more than 50 people.

KABUL, Afghanistan â€” A coordinated double suicide bombing by the Islamic State group hit central Kabul on Monday morning, killing at least 25 people, including nine Afghan journalists, officials said.
An AFP photographer, a cameraman for the local Tolo TV station and several reporters for the Afghan branch of Radio Free Europe were among the fatalities, police said.
At least 45 people were wounded in the twin attacks, according to Kabul police spokesman, Hashmat Stanekzai, who also said four policemen were among those killed.
The attack was the latest in a relentless string of deadly large-scale bombings and assaults that have struck Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan so far this year. And even as the Afghan capital reeled from Mondayâ€™s assault, a suicide car bombing a few hours later in the southern province of Kandahar killed 11 children, a police spokesman said. Eight Romanian NATO soldiers were wounded in that bombing.
In a statement posted on an IS-affiliated website, the Islamic State group said two of its martyrdom seekers carried out the Kabul bombings, targeting the headquarters of the â€œrenegadeâ€ Afghan intelligence services.
The blasts took place in the central Shash Darak area, home to NATO headquarters and a number of embassies and foreign offices â€” as well as the Afghan intelligence service.
Stanekzai, the police spokesman, said the first suicide bomber was on a motor bike while the second explosion meant to hit those scrambling to get to the scene to help the victims of the first blast.
The second attacker was on foot, in a crowd of reporters rushing to the site of the first attack, pretending to be one of the media, the spokesman said. The bomber then detonated his explosives while still among the reporters, Stanekzai said, intentionally targeting journalists.
Agence France-Presse said the news agencyâ€™s chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, was among those killed. AFP said Marai died in a blast that struck journalists who had rushed to the scene of the earlier attack.
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said along with the nine journalists killed, six were wounded. However, Sediqullah Tawhidi, an official with the Afghan Journalist Safety Committee, sad only five journalists wounded. Conflicting casualty tolls are common in the immediate aftermath of big attacks.
The Paris-based group named the journalists, working for media organizations from multiple countries, adding that Mondayâ€™s attack was the deadliest targeting reporters since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. The group, also known by its French acronym RSF, said 36 media workers have been killed in Afghanistan in attacks by IS or the Taliban since 2016.
RSF urged the Afghan government to do more to protect journalists.
Survivors and witnesses recounted scenes of mayhem.
Jawed Ghulam Sakhi, a 28-year-old a taxi driver said â€œwhen the explosion happened, everywhere was covered with dust and fire, it was such a horrific sceneâ€ with bodies and body parts â€œthrown about on the street and the pavement.â€
â€œI saw journalists covered with blood, this time they targeted the media,â€ Sakhi added.
Masouda, a young woman who was with her husband nearby, assailed the authorities. Her husband was wounded and was taken to the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital.
â€œI donâ€™t know who is responsible for all these attacks, every day we lose our loved ones and no one in this government is taking responsibility for the killing of these innocent people,â€ she said.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attacks. The presidential palace released a statement saying that attacks targeting innocent civilians, worshippers inside the mosques, national and democratic processes, reporters and freedom of speech all are war crimes.
The U.S. Embassy also condemned the â€œsavage bombingsâ€ in Kabul and reiterated its support for the Afghan people and Ghaniâ€™s government in their fight against terrorism.â€
â€œWe extend our deepest condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues of all the victims, including a number of brave journalists among the dead and injured,â€ it said, adding that â€œwhere media are in danger, all other human rights are under greater threat.â€
Kabul chief of police Dawood Amin said the area hit was quickly sealed off and authorities were investigating. Mohammad Mousa Zahir, director of Wazir Akbarkhan Hospital, said several people suffering injuries from the blasts were being treated at his hospital.
In its claim of responsibility, the Afghan affiliate of IS, known as Khorasan Province, said the first martyrdom seeker detonated his explosive vest near the intelligence service in central Kabul, forcing officers to head to the area of the explosion. The statement said the second attacker detonated his explosives vest after that. The statement, which exaggerated the overall death toll as militant claims often do, did not say journalists were specifically targeted.
In the Kandahar attack, an Afghan official said a suicide bomber targeted a NATO convoy in the district of Daman but killed 11 children from a religious school nearby. The children had gathered around the NATO convoy for fun when the bomber struck, said Abdul Rahim Ayubi, a lawmaker from Kandahar.
Matiullah Helal, deputy spokesman for the provincial police chief, said 16 people were also wounded in that attack, including NATO soldiers, civilians and policemen.
Romaniaâ€™ defense minister, Mihai Fifor, said eight Romanian troops with the â€œCarpathian Eaglesâ€ were among the wounded. NATO said the wounded service members, who are all in stable condition, were taken to Kandahar Airfieldâ€™s hospital for treatment.
Gen. John Nicholson, commander of NATOâ€™s Resolute Support mission, said in a statement that â€œif the enemies of Afghanistan think their cowardly actions will deter the commitment of the brave Afghan forces and our Resolute Support advisers, or the call by the Afghan people for peace, they are sorely mistaken.â€
In other violence Monday, at least four Afghan policemen were killed in northern Balkh province, said Sher Mohammad Abu-Tariq, the district chief in Nahri Shahi. The insurgents ambushed the police vehicle and fired RPGs.
Also, an Afghan police officer was killed and four people were wounded in an explosion in eastern Nangarhar province, said Attuhullah Khogynai, spokesman for the provincial governor. He said the slain officer was the chief of the criminal investigations unit for Behsud district.
No one claimed responsibility for the other attacks. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan first emerged in Nangarhar a few years ago, then expanded its footprint to elsewhere across the country.
IS and the more firmly established Taliban carry out regular attacks, with the Taliban usually targeting the Afghan government and security forces and IS targeting members of the countryâ€™s the Shiite minority, whom the affiliate perceives as apostates.
The relentless assaults underscore the struggles that Afghan security forces have faced to reign in the militant groups since the United States and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. Both groups want to establish strict Islamic rule in Afghanistan.
Last week, an Islamic State suicide bomber attacked a voter registration center in Kabul, killing 60 people and wounding at least 130 others. There were 22 women and eight children among the fatalities.
And the month before, an IS suicide bomber targeted a Shiite shrine in Kabul where people had gathered celebrating the Persian new year. That attack killed 31 people and wounded 65 others.

RFE/RL Journalists Among 25 Killed In Kabul Suicide Bombings

","
KABUL -- Two RFE/RL journalists were among at least 25 people killed in a pair of coordinated suicide bombings that rocked central Kabul near the headquarters of Afghanistan's intelligence agency.
A third reporter who was expected to join RFE/RL in May was also killed and the Afghan Journalists Center (AFCJ) said at least nine journalists died in the April 30 attacks, the worst toll ever among media workers in a single attack in the country. 
A BBC journalist was killed in a separate attack the same day in Khost Province, south of Kabul, the British broadcaster said. 
The extremist group Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the blasts, in the capital, which the Afghan Free Media Support Foundation (NID) reported killed 29 people.
Police and the Health Ministry put the number of dead at 25, and police said 45 wounded victims were hospitalized -- including six journalists. Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai was quoted as saying that four police officers were killed.

Health Ministry officials said a suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in the Shash Darak area, home to NATO headquarters and several embassies and foreign offices as well as the Afghan intelligence service. 
A second blast followed about 20 minutes later when a suicide bomber pretending to be a reporter blew himself up outside the headquarters of the Urban Development and Housing Ministry among the journalists covering the first explosion.
One RFE/RL journalist, Abadullah Hananzai, was killed in the second blast. Another, Sabawoon Kakar, was injured and died later in the hospital. 
""This is devastating news,"" said RFE/RL President Thomas Kent. ""We are appalled by the loss of these courageous journalists and colleagues, and heartbroken for their families.""
Maharram Durrani, a 28-year-old who was to begin working for RFE/RL in mid-May, was also killed. She was at the scene of the attack, but not as an RFE/RL reporter, when it occurred.
Video and photographs from the scene showed bodies strewn about streets littered with rubble as soldiers and onlookers rush to help the wounded, sirens from a stream of ambulances wailing in the background.
â€œThe targeting of civilians, worshipers in mosques, national and democratic processes, journalists, and freedom of expression are concrete examples of war crimes,"" President Ashraf Ghani said in a statement. ""This terrorist act is in conflict with Islamic values and human rights.â€ 
Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai as saying that four police officers were killed in the explosions. 
In a statement issued via its Amaq news agency, IS claimed responsibility for the blasts and said they targeted the headquarters of what the extremist group called the ""renegade"" Afghan intelligence services in Kabul.
General John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan said: ""We condemn in the strongest terms possible the cowardly attacks in Kabul today by two suicide bombers that killed and injured Afghan forces and innocent Afghan citizens, including Afghan journalists.
In a separate blast on April 30 in the southern part of the country, 11 children were killed and 16 others, including five Romanian soldiers, were injured, when a bomb-filled car exploded in the southern province of Kandahar, provincial police spokesman Qasim Afghan said. 
â€œMake no mistake, the enemies of Afghanistan cannot win. Actions like this one only strengthen our steadfast commitment to the people of Afghanistan,â€ Nicholson added.

In a condolence message, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that the ""people of Afghanistan continue to pay the heaviest price for the conflict ravaging their country."" 
""They also continue to suffer from a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law: civilians, and most of all children, must never be a target,"" she said, adding that journalists' work is ""vital for its contribution to democracy and to fundamental freedoms.""
Kakar, 30, had been a member of the video team for RFE/RLâ€™s Radio Free Afghanistan for five years.
Hananzai, 26, was a journalist and video cameraman who had been working on an antinarcotics project for RFE/RLâ€™s Radio Free Afghanistan called Caravan of Poison. 
AFP said that Shah Marai, the French news agency's chief photographer in Kabul, was among the journalists killed.
The AFJC said the other journalists killed were Ali Salimi and Salim Talash of MashalTV, Nawruz A. Khamoosh and Ghazi Rasuli of 1TV, and Yar Moh Tokhi of ToloNews.
BBC Afghan reporter Ahmad Shah, 29, was killed in an attack in Khost Province on the Pakistani border, BBC World Service Director Jamie Angus said on Twitter.
â€œAn attack on the media is an attack on democracy and an effort to silence the voice of voiceless. I condemn today's terrorist attacks and wish speedy recoveries to those wounded,"" Afghan Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah said on Twitter.
The twin bombings in Kabul came eight days after a suicide blast killed 60 people and wounded at least 120 outside a voter-registration center in the capital, a blow to efforts to hold long-delayed parliamentary elections in October.
IS claimed responsibility for the April 22 attack in Dashte Barchi, a heavily Shi'ite-populated area in western Kabul, also through Amaq. The Sunni extremist group has frequently targeted Afghanistanâ€™s Shi'ite minority, which IS calls â€œapostates.â€
The government in Kabul is also battling Taliban militants, who were driven from power by the U.S.-led invasion 17 years ago. 
Hundreds of people have died in several attacks in Kabul since the beginning of the year, despite Ghani's offer of peace talks with the Taliban militant group ""without preconditions.""

The Ministry of Public Health on Wednesday evening confirmed the death toll had risen to 48 in the suicide bombing in a classroom at anÂ education academy in Dasht-e-Barchi in PD18.
The explosion happened at about 4.10pm local time while students were in class. At least 67 people were also wounded.
Photographs released on social media after the explosion were testimony to the carnage caused inside theÂ classroom at Mawoud Academy.
Mawoud Academy is a private education facility that provides tertiary education programs to students wanting to go to university. The academy is known for providing a high standard of education.Â Â 
This academy's classes are mixed, with both girls and boys attending. About 100 students were believed to have been in the classroom at the time of the explosion.
Reporting live from the scene of the explosion, TOLOnews journalist Samim Faramarz said eyewitnesses claimed thatÂ the average age of the victims was around 18.
These teenagers had been taking classes in preparation for Kankor (the university entrance exam).
Desperate relatives of victims gathered outside the academy waiting for information, while many more went to Istiqlal HospitalÂ Â â€“ where most of the victims were taken.
Family members however voiced their anger over the security situation and said government should have provided better security to protect the academy which they said ""was under threat in the past"".
The Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack.Â

Many of those killed were teenagers who were getting extra tuition as they prepared for university entrance exams.

In the northern province of Baghlan, an attack killed at least nine policemen and 35 soldiers, officials say.

Taliban militants denied involvement in the Kabul attack, in a mostly Shia Muslim area.

The Shia community in Afghanistan has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni Muslim extremists of the Islamic State group, which views the Shia practice of Islam as heretical.

On the same day, the Taliban said it could no longer guarantee safe passage for Red Cross staff working in Afghanistan, amid a row over the treatment of Taliban prisoners in a jail in Kabul.

Who were the victims in Kabul?
The attack on the education centre took place at about 16:00 local time (11:30 GMT).

Updated at 6:20 a.m. ET on Thursday A suicide bombing in Kabul on Wednesday killed dozens of teenagers studying for university entrance exams at an educational center in a Shiite neighborhood, according to wire reports.  The Islamic State on Thursday claimed responsibility. The bombing resembles previous attacks that have also been claimed by ISIS. The blast comes less than a day after a Taliban attack in northern Afghanistan killed more than 30 police officers and soldiers, and less than a week after the Taliban launched a surprise attack on the city of Ghazni.  The explosion on Wednesday, ""targeting an educational center in the west of the Afghan capital, tore through a large tent set up as a classroom in the courtyard,"" Reuters reports.  Initially, Reuters said that the blast killed at least 48 and wounded at least 67, but later reports said 34 students were killed and 56 hurt. The attack came after weeks of ""relative calm"" in Afghanistan's capital, according to the news agency. The Taliban denied responsibility, Reuters says.

Surprise Taliban Attack Leads To Days Of Fighting, Hundreds Of Deaths






Both male and female students were studying at the center, preparing for entrance exams. One witness told Reuters that the scene at the educational center was ""horrific."" Another, a man whose 18-year-old daughter survived the attack, told the AP he saw blood and body parts covering benches and desks.  ""The savage terrorists are targeting cultural and educational institutions, showing that they are against the teachings of Islam and the Prophet encouraging all Muslims, men and women, to seek knowledge and learning,"" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said in a statement.  The attack targeted the Shiite neighborhood of Dasht-i-Barcha, the AP says:  ""The bombing, blamed on the Islamic State group, was the latest assault on Afghanistan's Shiite community, which has increasingly been targeted by Sunni extremists who consider Shiites to be heretics. ""It also showed how militants are still able to stage large-scale attacks, even in the heart of Kabul, and underscored the struggles of the Afghan forces to provide security and stability on their own.""  The attack comes after a bloody week in Afghanistan.  Early on Wednesday, the Taliban attacked a checkpoint in Baghlan, in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 30 police officers and soldiers, the AP says.  Reuters reports the death toll could be as high as 44:  ""The defence ministry confirmed the incident early on Wednesday, but gave no details. Officials in the area said nine police and 35 soldiers were killed in the latest attack of a series that has killed dozens of security forces nationwide. ""A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the group targeted a military base and two checkposts in Baghlan, killing 70 Afghan security forces, and seizing armoured vehicles and ammunition.  


Also on Wednesday, the Taliban attacked a police checkpoint in southern Zabul province, killing several police officers, a police chief told the AP. And six young girls were killed after playing with an unexploded rocket shell, an official in the eastern province of Laghman told the wire service.  On Tuesday, the AP says, the Taliban killed 17 soldiers in northern Faryab province after besieging an army base for several days.  These bloody attacks come come less than a week after the Taliban launched a surprise attack in the city of Ghazni, not far from Kabul. That assault began last Friday.  ""It took Afghan forces â€“ assisted by U.S. advisors â€“ five days to repel the insurgents,"" NPR's Diaa Hadid reports. ""The fighting killed more than 120 security forces and civilians and more than 200 insurgents. ""The Taliban's increasingly brazen attacks in recent weeks may be a way of strengthening their position ahead of widely-expected talks with the United States,"" Hadid says.  NPR's Ayda Pourasad contributed to this report.

    ","KABUL (Reuters) â€“ Afghan authorities revised down on Thursday the death toll from a suicide bomb attack on an educational centre in Kabul to 34 from 48, health ministry officials said.Some bodies had been double-counted when they were being taken to hospital from the blast site following the attack on Wednesday, the ministry said.The injury toll was revised to 56 from 67.Most of the victims were students preparing for university entrance exams in a classroom at the Mawoud Academy in an area of west Kabul where many members of the cityâ€™s mainly Shiâ€™ite Hazara community live.Investigators said the bomber entered the centre from a rear entrance and made his way into a classroom where more than 100 students had gathered.Their funerals were due to take place on Thursday.There has been no claim of responsibility but the Taliban denied carrying it out.The Hazara have often been targeted by the hardline Sunni Islamic State militant group.The blast was the latest in a wave of attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians, soldiers and policemen over recent days.

No immediate claim of responsibility was made for the blasts in Dasht-e-Barchi, home to many members of the mainly Shia Muslim Hazara ethnic minority that has been targeted in the past by members of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Images taken at the scene showed young men in torn wrestling kit helping the wounded onto vehicles to be taken to hospital.
The first explosion was triggered by a suicide bomberÂ and was followed by a car bomb shortly after, saidÂ interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish. 
Afghan PresidentÂ Ashraf Ghani condemned the bombings.Â â€œAn attack on civilians and media workers of the country is an attack on freedom of speech and crime against humanity,â€ he said in a statement. 
A reporter and cameraman from Afghanistanâ€™s largest broadcaster, Tolo News, were killed in the second blast and four other local television crew were wounded, according to NAI, a group supporting open media in Afghanistan.
Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the second explosion hit as police were helping victims and a number of officers were wounded.
AlÂ Jazeeraâ€™s Jennifer Glasse, reporting from Kabul, said the second bomb appeared to target first responders and journalists.
â€œIt has been a very deadly year here for journalists and for Afghans alike,â€ Glasse said.
On April 30, twin explosions in Kabul killed nine media workers and 16 other people.
â€˜A lot of deadâ€™

Social media users who purportedly witnessed the attack said the bomber killed the guards at the club before blowing himself up inside.
He â€œdetonated inside where a large number of athletes had gathered. There are a lot of dead and woundedâ€, Mohammad Hanif said on Facebook.
Wednesdayâ€™s attack underlined the danger in Kabul as elections approach next month, as well as the threat facing the Hazaras â€“ a Persian-speaking minority that has long faced discrimination.
In mid-August, at least 34 people were killed in a suicide attack in front of an education centre in Dasht-e-Barchi, west of Kabul.
ISILÂ â€“ which has established a brutal reputation and which both the Western-backed government and the Taliban consider an enemy â€“Â claimed responsibility for that bombing.

","
Twin bombings at a wrestling training center in a predominately Shiâ€™ite neighborhood of Afghanistan's capital have killed at least 20 people and wounded 70 others, the Interior Ministry says.

Officials said a suicide bomber on September 5 blew himself up inside the sports hall, which is located in Dasht-e Barchi in western Kabul.

A car bomb went off nearby less than an hour after, as journalists and security forces gathered at the scene.
A reporter and a cameraman from Afghanistan's largest broadcaster, Tolo News, were among those killed and four other local television crew members were wounded, according to NAI, a group supporting open media in the country.
""An attack on civilians and media workers of the country is an attack on freedom of speech and crime against humanity,"" President Ashraf Ghani said in a statement.

At least seven police officers were also among those wounded, according to Kabul's police chief, General Daud Amin.

The extremist group Islamic State (IS), which often targets Afghanistan's Shi'a community, claimed responsibility for the twin bombings on its affiliated Amaq news agency.

On August 15, a suicide bombing at an education center in Dasht-e Barchi killed dozens of students.

IS militants claimed responsibility for that attack.
Journalists have paid a heavy price covering the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan.
At least 11 were killed in the first six months of the year, according to the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee.

A suicide bombing killed nine journalists in Kabul on April 30, in what became the deadliest single day for reporters in the country since the 2001 U.S. invasion.

      Two journalists among 20 killed in wrestling club blasts in Kabul

      Two journalists were among 20 people killed in Kabul in twin bomb attacks on a wrestling club on Wednesday, with the second blast targeting media and emergency services at the scene of the initial explosion. 
  

      The first attack took place around 6 p.m. local time when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest in the Maiwand Wrestling Club, according to deputy spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, Nasrat Rahimi.
  

Private broadcaster Tolo News said two of its journalists, Samim Faramarz, 28 and Ramiz Ahmadi, 23, died when the second explosion, a car bomb, was detonated after emergency services, journalists and police arrived at the scene.
  

      ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in the predominantly Shia Qala-e-Nazer neighborhood of Western Kabul.
  





      More journalists have been killed in Afghanistan than any other country during 2018, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ). 
  

      This year , 12 have died in the violence, including two in Wednesdayâ€™s attack. Another 10 journalists were killed in two attacks on the same day in April. They included a BBC reporter and a well-known photographer who had written about the dangers of reporting in the Afghan capital.
  

      â€œAfghan journalists have shown incredible bravery covering the news while being repeatedly targeted by a cynical enemy,â€ said Steven Butler, CPJâ€™s Asia program coordinator, in a statement.
  

      Dozens of Kabul residents have also been caught up in the escalating violence. At least 34 people were killed in a suicide attack targeting Shia at an education center in Kabul last month. ISIS claimed responsibility for that attack.
  

      The Taliban, along with other militant groups such as ISIS, routinely attack military and civilian targets in the country.
  

A recent UN report said the number of Afghan civilians killed in the first six months of this year has reached a record high.
  

    Peace talks


      In July, American diplomats met face-to-face with Taliban representatives in Qatar to discuss laying the groundwork for peace talks, according to The Wall Street Journal.
  

      However, last month the Taliban launched a brazen attack on Ghazni, a strategic city south of the capital, seizing key buildings and engaging in gunbattles with security forces. At least 16 people were killed and 40 injured, the majority of them Afghan security forces.
  

During a visit to Pakistan on Wednesday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Islamabad and Washington needed to work together for peace in Afghanistan.
  

      The Trump administration has claimed Islamabad is granting safe haven to militants who are waging a 17-year-old war in neighboring Afghanistan â€” a charge Pakistan denies. 
  

      Earlier this week US forces in Afghanistan confirmed the head of ISIS in the country was killed in a strike on August 25.
  

      The death of the leader is the third time US forces have killed a self-proclaimed head of ISIS in Afghanistan since July 2016, according to the US.
  

      The founder of the notorious Taliban-linked Haqqani network, which for decades has been responsible for kidnappings and suicide bombings against US forces and allies, has died, the Taliban announced earlier this week.

At least seven people were killed and 25 others wounded on Sunday afternoon in Kabul city when a suicide bomber targeted Ahmad Shah Massoud supporters, officials confirmed.
Â 
Kabul police chief spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the suicide bomber was riding in a motorcycle when he detonated his explosives among the supporters.Â 
The attack happened in Taimani in Kabul city while a convoy of Massoud supporters in cars and on motorcycles were driving through the area.Â 
The explosion happened after National Directorate of Security (NDS) officers gunned down another suicide bomber near the United States embassy in Kabul before he could detonate his explosives among a group of Massoud supporters.Â 
September 9 is the death anniversary of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the national hero of Afghanistan, who was assassinated by two insurgents posing as journalists in Takhar province in 2001.Â 
To mark the day, hundreds of Massoud supporters took to the roads in convoys of vehicles, firing indiscriminately into the air.Â 
The random gunfire rang out throughout the day in the capital. Shops were closed and streets were largely deserted as Kabul residents took shelter in their homes.Â 
Kabul police meanwhile said they had by mid-afternoon arrested over 100 people for shooting into the air and seized 10 weapons and 25 vehicles.Â

","At least seven people were killed and 25 wounded on Sunday when a suicide bomber on a motorcycle detonated explosives near a procession in Kabul commemorating the death of former anti-Soviet mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, a government official said. Police said the suicide attack came hours after another suspected suicide bomber was shot by police in Kabul before he could detonate his device. Government spokesman Wahid Majroh said that seven bodies and 25 injured people were taken to the hospital from the attack site. Earlier, gunfire could be heard across the city as demonstrators fired automatic weapons in aggressive displays of support for Massoud, an ethnic Tajik leader who was killed by suicide bombers in 2001. At least 13 people were injured by gunmen firing their weapons into the air in defiance of a ban on celebratory gunfire, officials said. With parliamentary elections approaching next month and rivalry between Afghanistanâ€™s ethnic groups on the increase, the annual commemoration day for Massoud has created a tense atmosphere in Kabul, where major roads were blocked by police. The blast came four days after more than 20 people were killed by a suicide bomber at a wrestling club in Kabul as well as a secondary blast apparently aimed at first responders and journalists.",https://english.alarabiya.net/News/2018/09/09/At-least-seven-killed-in-blast-near-procession-in-Afghan-capital

The blast on Monday took place close to the cityâ€™s Pashtunistan Square, whereÂ hundreds of people had been protesting over insecurity in the country.
Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesman for the interior ministry, said: â€œThe suicide attacker on foot wanted to target protesters, but he was stopped at a security checkpoint some 200 metres from the site.â€ 
 â€œThere have been casualties and I can say most of them are security forces.â€
Twenty people were wounded in the blast, which struck in front of a high school in downtown Kabul, according toÂ Najib Danish, an interior ministry spokesman.
Videos posted on social media appeared to show bodies lying on the ground moments after the bombing, but could not be verified by Al Jazeera.
The explosion came as additional security was rolled out across Kabul for the protest, which began on Sunday night and continued into Monday.Â 

{articleGUID}

Hundreds of members of the ethnic Shia-Hazara community had gathered to demand action against ongoing Taliban assaults in three districts of central Afghanistan. According to Danish, the rally had ended before the explosion.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL,Â also known asÂ ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack on its website, Amaq.
The group has claimed responsibility for most of the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent months.

A protest for better security had ended when the blast occurred, according to officials [Omar Sobhani/Reuters]

Growing unrest
Mondayâ€™s explosion is the latest in a series of attacks on civilians and security forces in the war-torn South Asian country.
Taliban fighters killed scores of security forces in the western province of Farah and the eastern province of Ghazni overnight on Monday.
Earlier, at least 37 local policemen were killed in Farah and 20 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in Ghazniâ€™s Jaghuri district on Sunday.

{articleGUID}

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the Ghazni attack and said in a text message that the armed group had captured Malistan district.
Fighting in the area has been ongoing since Wednesday, fanning fears that the violence could be rooted in ethnic or sectarian differences.
A US watchdog agency said last week that the Afghan government was struggling to regain control of districts lost to the Taliban while casualties among security forces had reached record levels.
The government has control or influence over 65 percent of the population, but only 55.5 percent of Afghanistanâ€™s 407 districts, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in a report.
The escalation in violence came as US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad returned to the region as part of efforts to persuade the Taliban to end the 17-year war.
Last week, Russia hosted a conference aimed at seeking peace attended by members of a government-appointed body for talks with the Taliban, its members based in Qatar and officials from 12 countries.
The meetings ended without the sides agreeing on a path to direct dialogue.

Deadly Clashes, Suicide Bombing Kill Dozens In Afghanistan
","

","
Dozens of people have been killed in violence across Afghanistan, including in a suicide bombing in Kabul targeting a protest by members of the mainly Shiâ€™ite Hazara minority, officials say. 
The Islamic State (IS) militant group claimed responsibility for the suicide blast on November 12 that killed at least six people and wounded 20 others in the center of the capital, where hundreds of people were protesting the governmentâ€™s failure to protect the Hazara community from Taliban attacks.
The explosion rocked the city as fighting raged in the central province of Ghazni, where Afghan forces and pro-government militias have been battling the Taliban for the past week. 
Officials said on November 12 that 25 Afghan security personnel were killed in Ghazni's predominately Hazara districts of Malistan and Jaghori. The Taliban also attacked a third district, Khas Oruzgan, in neighboring Oruzgan Province two weeks ago. 
The Taliban offensive in the three predominately Hazara districts has left dozens of government troops, pro-government Hazara militia men, and Taliban militants dead and forced hundreds of civilians to flee their homes. 
In the western province of Farah, at least 37 local police were killed when Taliban fighters overran several security checkpoints, regional officials said on November 12.
In a statement, the IS militant group said it targeted a gathering of Shi'ites. The extremist Sunni group considers Shi'ites as heretics and has frequently targeted them in recent years.
Afghanistan's main intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), said in a statement that the bomber was on foot and detonated his suicide vest before reaching the protesters. 
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh told RFE/RL that civilians and security personnel deployed to secure the city during the protest were among the dead. 
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, although the Taliban and the Islamic State (IS) militant groups have been blamed for similar attacks in the past.
The blast occurred near a security checkpoint near the Istiqlal high school in central Kabul, close to the area where ministry buildings and the Presidential Palace are located.
The Afghan president's office said protesters ended their demonstration after President Ashraf Ghani addressed the crowd and promised to send reinforcements to the besieged districts. 
Hazara Demand Protection
Hundreds of people had rallied for a second day in front of the Presidential Palace to protest against the government's inaction in sending reinforcements to the three districts under siege in the provinces of Ghazni and Oruzgan. 
â€œThe situation in the districts of Jahjori, Malistan, and Khas Oruzgan is critical,â€ an unnamed protester told RFE/RL. â€œThese areas need urgent air support and reinforcements.â€

â€œWe want the government and the world to know whatâ€™s happening there,â€ another protester told RFE/RL. â€œHow long can this cruelty and death go on?â€
Officials said that the Taliban killed 15 civilians and 10 members of the special forces in Ghazni on November 11, after the government said it had sent special forces backed by air strikes to the districts under attack. 
There have been fears that the violence could be rooted in ethnic or sectarian differences, pitting the Hazara against the Taliban, a predominately Sunni, ethnic Pashtun group. 
The Taliban was accused of committing human rights violations against Hazara during their 1996-2001 rule.
In the western province of Farah, at least 37 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in overnight attacks by Taliban fighters on checkpoints that triggered hours of fighting, local officials said on November 12. 
The spike in violence comes as visiting U.S. special envoy Zakmay Khalilzad held talks with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on November 11 in his latest round of meetings aimed at convincing the Taliban to take part in peace talks with Kabul to end the decades-long war in Afghanistan.
Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul, is also scheduled to visit Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, where the Taliban has a political office.
A recent U.S. government watchdog report said Kabul's control of Afghanistan had slipped in recent months as local forces made little or no progress against the Taliban.
The U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, citing NATO's Resolute Support mission, said this summer's casualty toll for Afghan forces had been worse than ever.

A suicide bomber detonated his explosives near Pashtunistan Square in Kabul city center on Monday killing at least six people and wounding 20 others, close to where hundreds of protesters had gathered. 

The explosion took place close to the busy circle, which is in the same area as the ministries of finance and justice and close to the Presidential Palace. 

The explosion happened just after 1.30pm local time. 

According to a ministry of interior spokesman, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives after being spotted by police. He said at least six people were killed and 20 wounded, including policemen, in the blast. 

Hundreds of protesters have been gathered in the area throughout the day after marching to the Presidential Palace early Monday in protest over the lack of security and ongoing Taliban threats in Ghazni and Uruzgan provinces. 

Security had been tightened from early morning in the area, with most roads closed to traffic, after protesters started gathering near the Presidential Palace. 

The ministry of interior said in a statement that the suicide bomber blew himself up at a check point in the area.

KABUL, Afghanistan â€” A suicide bomber attacked a demonstration by minority Shiites in the Afghan capital Monday, killing at least six people as the crowd protested a spate of deadly insurgent attacks on Shiite communities in Ghazni province, police and witnesses said.
Hundreds of ethnic Hazara Shiites had gathered outside the presidential palace since Sunday night, angry over the governmentâ€™s inability to stop a string of recent attacks on predominantly Hazara areas of the province southwest of the capital.
The protest disrupted daily life in Kabul, leading to the closures of major streets, government institutions and businesses. Police said the protest was the likely target of the bomber, who was on foot. Ambulances raced to the scene, and TV footage showed bodies strewn in the streets.
Ghazni city, the provincial capital, was overrun by Taliban forces in August, and voting in nationwide parliamentary elections in October was postponed indefinitely throughout the insecure province. But until now, its rural Hazara districts had been largely spared.
The Taliban has claimed the recent attacks, but affiliates of the Islamic State have also carried out numerous bombings and shootings in Shiite Hazara communities over the past two years.

ISLAMABAD â€”Â 
Afghan officials say at least 50 people were killed and 83 others were wounded in a suicide bomb blast at a gathering of religious scholars in the capital, Kabul.
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said the attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest as people were gathered to mark the Prophet Mohammad's birthday at a local wedding hall.








Hospital workers carry an injured person to a hospital after a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, Nov. 20, 2018.



Health Ministry official Wahedullah Majroh told VOA at least 24 people were brought to the hospital in â€œcritical condition.â€
President Ashraf Ghani condemned the â€œhorrendousâ€ attack. He declared Wednesday as a national day of mourning, saying the national flag will be flown at half-staff all in Afghan and diplomat missions abroad.
Witnesses told reporters there were around 1,000 people inside the hall, including prominent religious scholars.









The Taliban condemned the suicide bombing against the religious gathering, saying the insurgent group had nothing to do with the attack.
The Talibanâ€™s denial strengthened suspicions the bombing could be the work of Islamic Stateâ€™s Afghan branch, known as IS Khorasan Province or ISK-P.
U.S. Ambassador in Kabul, John Bass, tweeted that he is ""Sickened and deeply saddened by tonightâ€™s terror attack as the Ulema [clerics] Council marked the Prophetâ€™s Birthday.""







He extended condolences from the U.S. government to the families and followers of those killed and wounded.

Amnesty International also denounced the bloodshed in Kabul as a deliberate attack on civilians that constituted a war crime.
â€œArmed groups must immediately halt all attacks targeting civilians and indiscriminate attacks, while the Afghan government must make the protection of civilian lives its absolute priority,â€ the rights group said in a statement. â€œThis attack also once again highlights the irresponsibility of countries in the European Union who claim Afghanistan is a safe place for refugees and asylum seekers to be returned to.â€
No one has yet claimed responsibility for the blast.
According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), a total of 1,692 civilians were killed between January 1 and June 30 this year, marking the highest figure for civilian casualties recorded by the U.N. body

More than 50 people were killed when a suicide bomber targeted a gathering of scholars celebrating a religious holiday in Kabul on Tuesday, Afghan government officials said. ""A suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a wedding hall where Islamic religious scholars had gathered to commemorate the anniversary of the Prophet Mohammad's birth,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said, according to Reuters. At least 80 people were wounded. Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahid Majroh said 20 of those injured were in critical condition and that the death toll was likely to rise, The Associated Press reported. While no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, NPR's Diaa Hadid reported that the target ""suggested it was the work of Sunni extremists who believe any birthday celebration for the prophet Muhammad is idolatry."" Wednesday has been declared a national day of mourning by the Afghan president, according to Hadid.

A spokesman for the Kabul police, Basir Mujahid, told the AP that the organizers of the event had not asked for assistance in securing the wedding hall. ""The suicide bomber apparently walked in among those people â€” the explosives, according an Afghan official, very potent â€” and detonated himself,"" freelance reporter Jennifer Glasse told NPR's Morning Edition. ""The bomber definitely was trying to kill as many people as possible."" Glasse noted that the hall could hold up to 1,000 people. According to a waiter at the wedding hall, the scale of the destruction was immediately evident. 


""Everything was covered with smoke and dust,"" Mohammad Muzamil told the AP. ""There were dead bodies all around on the chairs, in large numbers.""

The U.S. State Department condemned the attack, saying in a statement, ""This shameless act comes as the Afghan people attempt to celebrate Milad-un-Nabi in peace, and reveals the cowardice and cruelty of those who perpetuate violence in Afghanistan."" The attack was the largest to hit Afghanistan's most populated city in recent months. ""Its been really quiet here in Kabul the last month or so,"" Glasse said. ""We had parliamentary elections in October â€” the Taliban and Islamic State had both targeted the run-up to those elections and the elections themselves. People have been watching and waiting to see what might happen."" In June, there was a three-day ceasefire between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which Glasse said raised many people's hopes for peace. ""Now people are wondering, what happens to the prospects for peace going forward,"" she said. ""Really, we're going to have to wait and see who claims responsibility for this bombing.""

The shelling took place on Thursday in Kabulâ€™s western neighbourhood of Dasht-e Barchi, predominantly populated by ethnic minority Hazaras, as politicians and members of the public gathered to remember Abdul Ali Mazari.
Mazari was a leader of the Hazaras killed by the Taliban in 1995.
Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Khoshal Sadat wrote on Twitter that one person involved in the attack had been arrested and a compound where the mortars were fired from was surrounded.
Several key Afghan politicians, including former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, as well as former national security adviser and presidential candidate, Hanif Atmar, participated in the gathering.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack.
The Hazaras have long suffered oppression and persecution in Afghanistan.Â They are now often targeted by groups swearing allegiance to the ISIL.

","
KABUL -- An Afghan presidential candidate and eight bodyguards of a rival candidate have been injured by a barrage of mortars that exploded in western Kabul, near a ceremony honoring a prominent Shi'ite leader who was killed by the Taliban more than 20 years ago.
Amid conflicting reports about the overall death toll, RFE/RL has confirmed that at least three people were killed in the March 7 attack, which was claimed by the extremist group Islamic State (IS), according to its Amaq news agency mouthpiece.
A large number of Afghan officials and political figures from all of Afghanistan's main ethnic groups were attending the ceremony in Kabul's predominantly ethnic Hazara neighborhood of Dasht-e Barchi to commemorate the 1995 death of Hazara leader Abdul Ali Mazari when mortar shells began exploding nearby.
They included Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani, former President Hamid Karzai, presidential candidate and former national-security adviser Hanif Atmar, presidential candidate Latif Pedram, and Mohammad Mohaqiq, the Hazara leader of the Hezb-i Wahadat party.
Pedram, an ethnic Tajik from the northeastern province of Badakhshan who heads the National Congress party, announced on his Facebook page that he sustained minor injuries from the mortar barrage.
Qadir Shah, a spokesman for Atmar, told RFE/RL that eight of Atmar's bodyguards were also injured.
RFE/R's correspondent at the commemoration ceremony reported that Abdullah had just finished giving a speech honoring the late Mazari when mortar shells started exploding outside of the event.
Abdullah, an ethnic Tajik politician from northern Afghanistan and a leading candidate in the July 20 presidential election, was not injured.
Esteqlal Hospital director Hududullah Nori told RFE/RL that the bodies of three people killed in the attack and 17 injured people were brought to the Kabul facility.
Health Ministry official Mohaibullah Zaeer said an initial check of all Kabul hospitals revealed that at least three people were killed and 32 wounded. Zaeer said those casualty figures were not final.
Earlier, another official who was at the ceremony said seven people were killed.
Health Ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar said at least three children were among the injured.
Interior Ministry spokesman Nusrat Rahimi told RFE/RL that government security forces had located and surrounded a walled compound in northeastern Kabul from where suspected militants launched the mortars.
""We have found the area from where the mortars were fired,"" Rahimi said. ""They were launched from Kabul's northeastern police district 18. So we have identified the area and surrounded the people who were firing the mortars.""
Meanwhile, Deputy Interior Minister Khoshal Sadat wrote on Twitter that one person involved in the attack had been arrested by the early afternoon on March 7.
On March 6, the IS group also claimed responsibility for an attack on a construction company in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed at least 17 people and triggered an hours-long gunbattle with security forces.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - An Afghan official says the death toll in a mortar attack in Afghanistanâ€™s capital Kabul has risen to 11, while the number of wounded has reached almost 100.
Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said Friday that Afghan security forces were among the wounded in the attack a day earlier.

Insurgents targeted a ceremony attended by the countryâ€™s chief executive and a former president, both of whom were unharmed.





The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack on the ceremony honoring a slain leader of Afghanistanâ€™s ethnic Hazaras. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims, reviled by the radical Sunni IS group.

Rahimi says two attackers were killed and a third was arrested. He added that those killed in the attack were all civilians.

The Taliban, by contrast have distanced themselves from attacks on Shiites in Afghanistan.Story continuesMeanwhile, IS claimed responsibility for an attack Wednesday on a construction company in eastern Nangarhar province that killed at least 17 people and triggered an hours-long gunbattle with Afghan forces, assisted by U.S. troops. The militant group on an affiliated website posted photographs of the two suicide bombers, both Afghan nationals.The dawn assault started with a suicide bombing outside the gates of a construction company by the airport in Jalalabad, the provincial capital. Afghan officials said a total of five insurgents were involved and that all were killed, including two suicide bombers.Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Taliban waged a blistering four-hour battle with security forces on Wednesday night in northern Kunduz province, in the Qalay Zul district, killing seven policemen, according to Mohammad Yosuf Ayubi, chairman of the provincial council. Ayubi said 90 percent of the district is now in Taliban hands.And early on Thursday, the Taliban killed four Afghan border patrol officers in western Herat province, near the border with Iran, said Gelani Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor.Attacks have continued in Afghanistan despite stepped-up U.S. efforts to find a negotiated resolution of the 17-year war, America's longest.U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is currently holding talks with the Taliban in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, where the insurgents have a political office. The latest round of talks is now in its second week, which has raised expectations that there could be some progress.___Associated Press writer Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report.",https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blasts-kabul-hit-near-ceremony-attended-top-officials-082850529.html

Hazaras have been repeatedly attacked by Sunni Muslim militant groups such as the Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State over the years. IS claimed responsibility via its Amaq news agency, saying it had targeted the Shi’ite gathering.

TOLO News, which had a camera crew reporting live, said at least 10 explosions were heard at the event to commemorate a Hazara leader’s death.“Our gathering is under attack. Rockets are being dropped on us from every direction,” said Muhammad Mohaqiq, a lawmaker and leader of the main Hazara political party from the stage in comments aired on television.

Hundreds of people including top government officials such as Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah and at least three candidates for a July presidential election were at the event.

People could be seen scattering in all directions as the rockets fell.Three people were killed and 32 others injured, including two children, Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry said in a statement. Security forces killed two suspected attackers, while a third suspect was arrested, it said.

Presidential candidate Mohammad Hanif Atmar was unhurt, but eight of his security guards were wounded. They were in stable condition, said Atmar’s spokesman, Qader Shah.

The gathering was for the anniversary of the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, a Hazara leader who died in 1995 after being taken prisoner by the Taliban.The attack came a day after a suicide bomb and gun attack on a construction company in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed at least 16 people.

The midmorning gathering, which drew several thousand mourners, was being held in a public arena to mark the anniversary of the death of a minority Shiite and ethnic Hazara leader, Abdul Ali Mazari, who was killed in 1995 by the Taliban. 

A year ago this week, a memorial service here for Mazari was attacked by a suicide bomber outside a mosque, killing 10 and injuring 22.Both attacks took place in southwestern Kabul, the heart of the capital’s large Shiite and Hazara community, which has been the target of dozens of bombings and other attacks in recent years. The 2018 bombing was also claimed by the Islamic State, a radical Sunni group that views Shiites as heretics and has claimed most terrorist attacks on Shiite targets.Witnesses said Abdullah, 58, who shares executive power with President Ashraf Ghani, was addressing the crowd Thursday when loud mortar fire was heard nearby and people scattered in panic. Abdullah was not harmed.Ghani, in a statement, called the attack a “criminal act” that showed “enmity toward civil values and democracy.”

Presidential candidate Latif Pedram, 55, a liberal politician and member of parliament, was wounded, but his condition was not immediately known. Eight guards of another presidential candidate, former national security adviser Hanif Atmar, were also injured.

“This was the most horrid and unforgivable attack on civilians by a merciless enemy,” Atmar tweeted several hours after the attack. He said he had arrived home unharmed. “I am pained by the loss of life and injury suffered by so many,” he wrote.Residents said two of the three people killed were inside a house near the event that was hit by mortar fire. Officials at the Interior Ministry said most of the rounds landed about 200 feet from the memorial site. The attackers had used another house in the area to launch the mortars at the crowd, the officials said.

The attack revived concern about the Islamic State’s violent agenda at a time when the country has been focused on reaching a peace settlement with the separate, domestic Taliban insurgency. The Taliban has stepped up aggressive attacks in recent months while its representatives have been meeting with U.S. officials to seek an end to the 17-year conflict.

Taliban forces attack southern Afghan military base as peace talks continue

In the past three years, the Islamic State has attacked mosques, shrines, political institutes, education centers and gymnasiums in southwestern Kabul, as well as in Herat and other Shiite-dominated areas, killing hundreds of people. Most of the attacks have been suicide bombings.

Interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said the death toll had risen to nine, including five members of the Afghan security forces, a guard at Counterpoint and three civilians.

Nusrat Rahimi, spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs, said the target of the attack was Counterpart International, an NGO headquartered in the United States that has been operating in Afghanistan since 2005.

The NGO’s office is located near the attorney general’s office in the Shahr-e-Naw area in Kabul.

Intermittent gunshots and explosions were heard as special forces, backed by advisers from foreign forces, surrounded the site and engaged the attackers in a standoff. Authorities cordoned off the area as they sent in ambulances and police trucks.

Rahimi said at least 80 employees of the NGO were rescued and security forces were clearing other buildings in the area.

“Two floors of the building have been cleared and, to avoid civilian casualties, the operation is being undertaken with caution,” Rahimi said.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the group attacked the NGO because it was involved in “harmful Western activities” in Afghanistan. He did not elaborate on what those activities were.

The blast came only two weeks after armed men targeted the communications ministry in central Kabul, killing at least seven people. That attack was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS).

Meanwhile, representatives of the US and Taliban continue their negotiations in Qatar aimed at bringing an end to the nearly 18-year-long conflict.The talks follow a peace summit in Kabul last week where President Ashraf Ghani offered a ceasefire from the first day of Ramadan, which was refused by the Taliban.

Last year, the Taliban announced a three-day ceasefire at the end of Ramadan after Ghani declared a unilateral truce for eight days earlier in the month.

It was first formal nationwide ceasefire since the US-led invasion of 2001 and saw unprecedented scenes of reconciliation and jubilation across the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/5/8/afghanistan-taliban-attacks-counterpart-international-in-kabul

The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, in the aftermath of which four terrorists were also killed, according to the Afghan government.

Just before noon local time on Wednesday, the attackers detonated an explosive-laden vehicle at the gates of non-governmental organization Counterpart International in the Afghan capital, said Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimy. Images following the blast showed a plume of black smoke rising over the city

Four terrorists were able to enter the organization’s offices before Afghan special forces arrived, Rahimy said. During a nearly five-hour battle, all four were killed. Two hundred of the organization’s employees were rescued by Afghan forces. The death toll includes one woman and one special forces member.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahid claimed responsibility for the attack.

Counterpart International is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and focuses on strengthening civil society and promoting social equality, according to its website. In a statement, the organization said it had worked in Afghanistan for 12 years and never faced a similar attack before.The US has been in on-again, off-again peace talks with the Taliban for months.

The attack in Kabul, the capital, which the Interior Ministry said also wounded 24, was a clear signal about the state of the peace process even after the Taliban leadership met with American negotiators last week in the sixth round of peace talks in Doha, Qatar.

The American charity CARE said three employees in its Afghanistan office were killed. CARE maintains a compound near the site of the contractor that was targeted, Counterpart International, which said all of its employees were safe and accounted for.

“Today’s attack showed that the Taliban don’t believe in peace — it was a direct message to the Americans that the Taliban will be the winner of the Afghan war,” said Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired Afghan Army general and military analyst.Mr. Amarkhel said the Taliban were declaring that “they are the leader of the peace talks and the Americans should listen to them and accept their demands.” Central to those demands is the United States’ agreement on a timeline for the withdrawal of American troops.

The five-and-a-half-hour siege on Wednesday began with a car bomb and ended when security forces killed all four armed infiltrators, said Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. Among those killed during the attack were an officer from an elite police response unit and an Afghan woman, and one of the wounded was a foreign national, he said.

Three employees of the humanitarian nonprofit CARE were also killed in the attack, the organization said in a statement.

The attackers targeted a compound operated by Counterpart International, which is primarily funded by the United States Agency for International Development. The group has operated in Afghanistan since 2005, focusing on civic engagement projects, according to its website.

In a Twitter post claiming responsibility for the attack, a Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, described Counterpart as “a U.S. network,” indicating that it was singled out because it is an American-led organization.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/world/asia/kabul-afghanistan-bombing.html

Counterpart International has operated in Afghanistan since 2005 and runs civic engagement projects, supporting women and other marginalised groups.

The charity has posted a statement saying: ""We are incredibly saddened by this attack and are working as quickly as possible to account for our staff. Their safety and security is our primary concern.""

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Counterpart International was involved in ""harmful Western activities"" and the ""inter-mixing"" of men and women.

Before they were ousted from power in 2001, the Taliban banned women from working outside their homes and insisted they be accompanied by a male relative.

Akbar Khan Sahadat, a prosecutor in the Attorney General's office close to the scene of the blast, told AFP how he had escaped.

""We started running out of the building and while running outside, I heard small gunfire and the sound of grenades going off nearby,"" he said.

John Bass, the US Ambassador to Afghanistan, opposed the attack in a tweet, describing it as ""senseless violence"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48204395

","Officials in Afghanistan say a Taliban car bomb-and-gun attack against a U.S.-funded international relief organization Wednesday killed at least five people, including a police guard, and wounded 24 others.Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said insurgents targeted the nonprofit group Counterpart International, which is a partner of the U.S. Agency for International Development, in the upscale Shahri Naw area of the capital.

The Afghan forces killed all five assailants in a gunfight that lasted nearly six hours. Rahimi would not say whether staff members of the aid group were among the casualties.Ann Hudock, president and chief executive of Counterpart International, told VOA's Afghan service Wednesday, ""There is still a lot of information that we don't know, including whether we were specifically targeted. But we do know there was a bomb blast and that our building was attacked by militants."" She said her staff was all accounted for and safe.

""What I can say is that the senseless violence that happened today has no place in a civilized world. It has nothing to do with Islam. For this to happen in Ramadan makes it particularly egregious,"" she said.Rahimi said police and military commandos quickly surrounded the building and fought the assailants, rescuing close to 200 people during the siege.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.

The insurgent raid began just before noon with a car bomb explosion at the entrance gate before several gunmen stormed the office building, said Rahimi.

The U.S.-funded aid organization has been operating in Afghanistan since 2005 on civic engagement projects, according to its website.

""In all our programs, we bring marginalized people into civic life, supporting their ability to influence decisions that affect their lives,"" Counterpart said in its mission statement on its website.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid accused the aid group of conducting ""harmful"" activities inside Afghanistan.""Counterpart implemented a dangerous program termed 'Angel' aimed at promoting open intermixing between men and women,"" Mujahid alleged in a statement sent to reporters.

He accused the aid group of employing ""40-50 foreign advisers"" working in various aspects of brutality, oppression, terror, anti-Islamic ideology and promotion of Western culture.

U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan John Bass strongly condemned the Taliban attack.

""The targeted organization helps local communities, trains journalists and supports the Afghan people. For this, it is the target of senseless violence. Thanks to Afghan Security Forces for rapid response,"" Bass said.

The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan also denounced as deplorable the ""deliberate targeting of the civilian aid organization"" by the insurgents.?

Coming as US negotiators try to reach a peace deal with the Taliban, the attack in Kabul is likely to fuel the concerns of critics who say the militant group cannot be trusted to protect women’s rights and other freedoms, whatever they may pledge at the negotiating table.

It began with a suicide blast at the entrance to Counterpart International’s Afghanistan headquarters in the centre of Kabul, near the offices of the attorney general.Five gunmen then raced inside the compound and battled special forces soldiers for more than six hours. About 200 people were evacuated from two buildings as the fighting raged.

Four of the dead were civilians and one was a policeman; 24 others were injured. Counterpart, which is based in the US and has operated in Afghanistan since 2005, said it was incredibly saddened by the attack and was “working as quickly as possible to account for our staff. Their safety and security is our primary concern.”

It was not immediately clear if any of the dead were employees of the organisation, which works with civil society in Afghanistan, including supporting women’s rights and young Afghans.

A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the group had been targeted because it carried out “harmful western activities” in Afghanistan, and one of its programmes was “promoting open inter-mixing between men and women”.

When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, before the US-led campaign to topple them in 2001, they barred women from education and most work, and forced them to wear the burqa.

When the group announced its annual “spring offensive” this year, it promised to be careful of civilians. The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, the US ambassador and the UN condemned the attack.

“Today’s attack particularly deplorable, hitting civilians helping Afghans & taking place during Ramadan,” the UN said on Twitter.

The sixth round of peace talks between the Taliban and the US is under way in Qatar. Donald Trump is keen to wrap up a war that has lasted more than 17 years, costing the US billions of dollars.

Afghan women have warned they are being excluded from the process, putting their hard-won achievements of the last two decades at risk and jeopardising the foundations of any future deal.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/08/taliban-attack-afghanistan-office-of-us-aid-group

Blast Kills At Least Eight Outside Kabul University

KABUL -- Afghanistanâ€™s Health Ministry says at least eight people have been killed when an explosion struck near the entrance to Kabul University.

Dr. Wahidullah Mayar, a ministry spokesman, said on July 19 that 33 people had also been wounded and taken to hospital.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility and it was not clear if the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber or remotely detonated.

Ferdous Faramarz, a spokesman for the Kabul police chief, said two vehicles caught fire after the blast.

Faramarz said police defused a second bomb that was placed close to the explosion site.

The explosion occurred as students were waiting outside the university to attend exams. 

The blast came after at least 12 people were killed and almost 90 wounded on July 18 when Taliban militants detonated two car bombs at a gate outside police headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar.

After the car bombs, Taliban gunmen opened fire from nearby positions, triggering a battle with security forces, said Tadeen Khan, the city's police chief.

The attackers targeted the counternarcotics wing of the police, Khan said.

Baheer Ahmadi, the spokesman for the Kandahar provincial governor, said 12 people had been killed, including nine civilians and three police officers.

Another 89 were wounded, he added.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told RFE/RL that Taliban militants had carried out the attack.

Afghan security forces across the country have been coming under nearly daily attacks by the Taliban.

The increase in violence comes despite reported progress in efforts by the United States to broker an end to Afghanistan's nearly 18-year war.

The U.S. peace envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, has held eight rounds of peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar. He described the latest round that ended on July 9 as the ""most productive"" ever.

Taliban negotiators also reported good progress at the talks, but the deadly violence has continued as Kabulâ€™s Western-backed government struggles to fend off attacks across the country by Taliban fighters, Islamic State extremists, and other militant groups.

Sixty-three people have died and 182 are injured after an explosion ripped through a wedding hall in the Afghan capital of Kabul.The blast happened at the Dubai City venue in the west of the city, which is home to many members of the Shiite Hazara community, with hundreds thought to be inside.



The interior ministry confirmed the death toll, which a presidential spokesman said was a ""heinous crime"" and Kabul's deadliest attack this year.






Sediq Seddiqi, spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani, said on Twitter: ""Devastated by the news of a suicide attack inside a wedding hall in Kabul. A heinous crime against our people; how is it possible to train a human and ask him to go and blow himself (up) inside a wedding?!!""According to guests present, there were around 1,200 people invited to the wedding.

Sunni Muslim militants have repeatedly attacked Shiite minorities in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan over the years.Just three weeks ago, a Taliban suicide bomber killed 14 people and wounded 145 in an attack in western Kabul.That incident came despite expectations of a deal between the terror group and the US, with both having reported progress in talks that would see American troops withdraw from Afghanistan in exchange for a security guarantee from the insurgents.

The Taliban has denied involvement and condemned the attack.What happened?
An IS statement said that one of its fighters blew himself up at a ""large gathering"" while others ""detonated a parked explosives-laden vehicle"" when emergency services arrived.

The Afghan interior ministry confirmed the death toll hours later. Pictures on social media showed bodies strewn across the wedding hall amid overturned chairs and tables.

Afghan weddings often include hundreds of guests who gather in large halls where the men are usually segregated from the women and children.

What could peace in Afghanistan look like?
The groom who gave his name as Mirwais told local TV: ""My family, my bride are in shock, they cannot even speak. My bride keeps fainting.

""I lost my brother, I lost my friends, I lost my relatives. I will never see happiness in my life again.""

""I can't go to the funerals, I feel very weak ... I know that this won't be the last suffering for Afghans, the suffering will continue,"" he said.The bride's father told local media that 14 members of his family were killed in the attack.

""Several of our waiters were killed or wounded,"" he added.The explosion took place in the west of the city, mostly populated by Shia Muslims.

Sunni Muslim armed groups including the Taliban and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group have repeatedly attacked the Shia Hazara minorities in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan over the years.
â€œDevastated by the news of a suicide attack inside a wedding hall in Kabul,â€ Sediq Seddiqi, spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani, said in a Twitter post.
â€œA heinous crime against our people; how is it possible to train a human and ask him to go and blow himself [up] inside a wedding?!!â€
Armed individuals and groups have periodically struck Afghan weddings, which are seen as â€œsoftâ€ targets with minimal security precautions.
Saturdayâ€™s explosion shattered more than a week of calm in the Afghan capital.
Ten days ago, a Taliban car bomb aimed at Afghan security forces ripped through a busy west Kabul neighbourhood in the same district, killing 14 people and wounding 145. Most were civilians.
That blast and the one that happened on Saturday occurred on the same road.
The blast comes at a greatly uncertain time in Afghanistan as the US and the Taliban near a deal to end a nearly 18-year war.

Suicide Bombing of Wedding Party in Kabul Killed 63

Story updated at 7:00 a.m.
The Islamic State group's Afghan branch has claimed responsibility for the wedding bombing in Kabul that killed at least 63 and wounded at least 183.
The victims of the overnight suicide bombing at a packed wedding hall were mostly members of the minority Shiâ€™ite Hazara community.
Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi confirmed the casualty toll in a statement issued early Sunday, saying women and children were among the victims.









The United Nations denounced the wedding hall bombing as an â€œatrociousâ€ act against Afghan Shiâ€™ites, saying it has documented several previous attacks aimed at the community. â€œAn attack deliberately targeting civilians is an outrage, and deeply troubling, as it can only be described as a cowardly act of terror,â€ said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the head of the U.N. Assistance mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).
U.S. ambassador to Kabul John Bass in a tweet condemned the carnage as an act of ""extreme depravity.""
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the overnight attack as an â€œinhumaneâ€ act, saying he has summoned an â€œextraordinaryâ€ security meeting to review and prevent such security lapses.
The attack was one of the worst against Afghan civilians in recent years.
The Taliban condemned the bombing. A spokesman for the insurgent group said â€œsuch barbaric deliberate attacks against civilians including women and children are forbidden and unjustifiable.â€
â€œTaliban cannot absolve themselves of blame, for they provide platform for terrorists,â€ Ghani noted in his statement issued Sunday.
Survivors said hundreds of guests were inside the hall when the blast occurred.
 â€œI was with the groom in the other room when we heard the blast, and then I couldn't find anyone. Everyone was lying all around the hall,â€ said Ahmad Omid.
The blast occurred near the stage where musicians were and ``all the youths, children and all the people who were there were killed,'' witness Gul Mohammad said. One of the wounded, Mohammad Toofan, said that ``a lot of guests were martyred.''

The brideâ€™s father told TOLO television station that 14 members of his family were killed in the bombing of his daughter's wedding and three were still missing.
""I know that this will not be the last suffering for Afghans. This suffering will continue. This will not be the last incident to happen against innocent people,"" the groom, identified as Mirwais, told the private Afghan news station.
Separately, a roadside bomb hit a civilian vehicle Sunday in the northern province of Balkh, killing at least eleven people.
Mohammad Yousaf, the head of Dawlat Abad district where the early morning incident took place, told VOA women and children were among the victims.
â€œTaliban cannot absolve themselves of blame, for they provide platform for terrorists,â€ Ghani noted in his statement issued Sunday.

Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict in Afghanistan, where more than 1,500 were killed or wounded in July alone, according to the United Nations.
U.S.-Taliban talks
The attack in Kabul came as the United States and the Taliban are closing in on an agreement to end a nearly 18-year war â€” America's longest conflict. 

The Afghan government has been excluded from those negotiations, and presidential spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said Saturday that his government was waiting to hear results of President Donald Trump's meeting Friday with his national security team about the discussions.
Among the key issues are the withdrawal of U.S. troops and Taliban vows not to let Afghanistan become a launching pad for global terror attacks.

Seddiqi said that the Afghan government expects the deal will result in cessation of Taliban-led violence, and direct negotiations between Kabul and the insurgent group.
The Taliban, however, maintains it will discuss a cease-fire and other domestic political issues in intra-Afghan negations once the United States announces the troop withdrawal timetable.
 Last year, more than 3,800 civilians, including more than 900 children, were killed in Afghanistan by the Taliban, U.S. and allied forces, the Islamic State affiliate and other actors, the United Nations said.

They are battling government and U.S.-led international forces and the Taliban.The U.S. special envoy for reconciliation in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said the attack showed the need to accelerate efforts to reach a deal with the Taliban, to help defeat Islamic State.The Sunni Muslim group, in a statement on the messaging website Telegram, claimed responsibility for the attack at a west Kabul wedding hall in a minority Shiâ€™ite neighbourhood, saying its bomber had been able to infiltrate the reception and detonate his explosives in the crowd of â€œinfidelsâ€.Islamic State has claimed some of the most bloody attacks in Afghan cities over the past couple of years, with some aimed at the Shiâ€™ite minority.The Taliban had earlier denied responsibility for the blast and condemned it.More than 180 people were wounded, with many women and children among the casualties, interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said on Sunday as grieving families thronged to Kabulâ€™s crowded cemeteries.â€œWe want peace, not such brutal suicide attacks,â€ said Ahmad Khan, who was burying a relative.Slideshow ( 10 images )Pictures on social media from the scene of the blast showed bodies strewn amid overturned tables and chairs, with dark blood stains on the wedding hall carpet.Both the bride and groom survived.â€œI wonâ€™t ever be able to forget this, however much I try,â€ the groom, Mirwais Elmi, told the TOLOnews channel.He said his cousin and some friends had been killed.The brideâ€™s father told TOLOnews that 14 members of his family were killed.BLOODSHED AND TALKSBrightly lit wedding halls that line some suburban streets of the city have been targeted previously by bombers. At least 40 people were killed in a blast in November.There has been no let-up in fighting and bomb attacks in Afghanistan over recent months despite talks between the United States and the Taliban since late last year.Slideshow ( 10 images )President Ashraf Ghani, in comments on the Kabul blast before the Islamic State claim, said the Taliban could not â€œabsolve themselves of blame for they provide a platform for terroristsâ€.Celebrations for Mondayâ€™s 100th anniversary of Afghanistanâ€™s independence from Britain were curtailed out of respect for the blast victims, the presidentâ€™s office said.The Taliban has been fighting to expel foreign forces and re-establish a theocratic Islamic state since its ousting in October 2001, weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.Both U.S. negotiators and the Taliban have reported progress after eight rounds of talks since late last year.U.S. President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire for a U.S. pullout from Afghanistan and an end to Americaâ€™s longest war.But there are concerns among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides that Afghanistan could be plunged into a new civil war that could herald a return of Taliban rule and international militants, including Islamic State, finding a refuge.Afghan government officials also fear that a Taliban pact could drive some die-hard Taliban fighters into the arms of Islamic State.Under the expected deal, the Taliban, in exchange for a U.S. commitment to withdraw, would guarantee that Afghanistan would not be a sanctuary for militants to expand and plot new attacks.The United States also wants a Taliban commitment to hold power-sharing talks with the government and announce a ceasefire. The Taliban have refused to talk to the government.U.S. envoy Khalilzad said the peace process had to be accelerated, in particular the intra-Afghan talks.â€œSuccess here will put Afghans in a much stronger position to defeat ISIS,â€ he tweeted, referring to Islamic State.About 14,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, training and advising Afghan security forces and conducting counterinsurgency operations.Reporting by Orooj Hakimi in KABUL, Matin Sahak in MAZAR-I-SHARIF; Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore/Gareth Jones/David Goodman/Jane MerrimanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-blast-idINKCN1V800R

The attack also wounded 20 people, including four of the companyâ€™s foreign staff, but their nationalities were not released. Reports in the immediate aftermath of the attack said seven died but a new death toll was later released.




The explosion occurred in the Qasaba area in the Afghan capital. The GardaWorld security company â€“ based in Montreal, Canada â€“ was the apparent target, according to Nasrat Rahimi, an interior ministry spokesman.Â 
A vehicle belonging to the security company and two private cars were damaged in the attack, Rahimi added.
Ambulance sirens were heard shortly after the car bomb went off and a large plume of smoke rose from the area â€“ scenes all too familiar for Kabul and other cities and towns across Afghanistan.
Among those killed were 12-year-old Dunya and her 7-year old brother who were on their way to school. 
The two children were walking with their father when the car-bomb detonated. The father, who was severely wounded and lost a leg and a hand, was in hospital, according to reports on social media.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
The Taliban and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) are active in the capital and have previously claimed attacks in Kabul.
The Taliban control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan, staging near-daily attacks that target Afghan forces and government officials but also kill scores of civilians.

â€˜Deadly friendly fireâ€™
In other violence, at least four Afghan army soldiers were killed on Monday night during an air strike by US forces in eastern Logar province, said Anwar Khan Ishaqzai, the provincial governor. Six other troops were wounded in the attack near Puli Alam, the provincial capital.
The air strike came as a gun battle was under way between the army and the Taliban in the area, the governor said, adding an investigation was started into the â€œfriendly fireâ€ strike.
A spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan said the coalition was aware of the reports from Logar.
â€œUS and Afghan forces are working closely together to develop a shared understanding of this event. A joint investigation is ongoingâ€ said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity under regulations.
Also on Monday night, five policemen were shot and killed at their checkpoint in western Herat province, said Abdul Ahid Walizada, the provincial police chiefâ€™s spokesman. Walizada said three other police officers were wounded in the attack in Oby district.

The violence came a day after President Ashraf Ghani announced the government in Kabul would release three high-ranking Taliban prisoners in an apparent prisoner swap for Western hostages who had been kidnapped by the group in 2016.Â 
The three Taliban prisoners include Anas Haqqani, who was seized in 2014 and whose older brother is the deputy Taliban leader and head of the Haqqani network, a Taliban affiliate.
Ghani did not specify the fate of the Western hostages â€“ an Australian and an American, both professors at the American University in Kabul â€“ and it was not clear when or where they would be freed.
The president said on Tuesday he hoped the decision would help â€œpave the wayâ€ for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate with the administration in Kabul.

Car Bomb Kills 12 in Afghan Capital, Kabul

Ayaz Gul-VOA


","
A car bomb explosion in the Afghan capital of Kabul Wednesday killed at least 12 people and wounded about 20 others, including children.
Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi tweeted the early morning blast targeted a foreign private security company vehicle. He said four foreign employees of the company were among those injured but gave no further details.
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the bombing, which came after days of a lull in violence in Kabul.
Taliban insurgents and militants linked to the Afghan branch of Islamic State often claim credit for plotting such attacks.
Wednesdayâ€™s violence comes a day after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani freed three high-profile Taliban prisoners in exchange for two Western hostages, an American and an Australian.
The two foreigners were teaching at Kabulâ€™s American University of Afghanistan before they were kidnapped at gunpoint near the campus in August 2016.
Meanwhile, the country's Independent Election Commission (IEC) Wednesday postponed for a second time the announcement of preliminary results from the Afghan presidential polls.
The commission was due to release first results on November 14 after failing to meet the original deadline of October 19. But the IEC spokesman Abdul Aziz Ibrahimi said the results would not be announced on Thursday â€œuntil the technical issues are addressed.â€
Incumbent President Ghaniâ€™s main challenger Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah earlier this week withdrew his team of observers from the vote recounting process, demanding IEC declare as invalid around 300,000 â€œfraud-markedâ€ votes if he were to accept the results.

Car Bomb Explodes In Afghan Capital, Killing At Least 12

At least 12 people were killed and 20 others wounded when a car bomb detonated during the morning rush hour in the Afghan capital, officials said.

The November 13 bombing targeted a private security company's convoy in the Qasaba area in Kabul's police District 15.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, which came a day after the Afghan government released three key Taliban prisoners in exchange for two Western hostages.

Both the Taliban and the Islamic State militant group are active in Kabul.

The Interior Ministry said the dead were civilians and included three children.

Afghan Government Releases Militants In Apparent Exchange For American, Australian Captives








One of them was a 13-year-old child heading to school, Interior Minister Massoud Andarabi said.

""The enemies of our people should know that our people are determined for peace. Nothing can stop them from achieving peace,"" Andarabi said.

Four foreign staff of the private Canadian security company GardaWorld were among those wounded, said Marwa Amini, an Interior Ministry spokesman.

Their nationalities were not given.

On November 12, President Ashraf Ghani said three high-ranking Taliban prisoners were released in exchange for two professors of the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul -- an American and an Australian -- who were kidnapped by the militants in 2016.

Ghani did not specify the fate of the Western hostages and it was not clear when or where they would be freed.

Those released included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani network, officials said.
Neither the Taliban nor the Haqqani network, which is part of the militant group, have commented so far on the prisoner swap.

Some analysts had hoped the prisoner release could pave the way for peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The militant group has so far refused to talk to the Afghan government, which it says is a U.S. puppet.

While a healthÂ ministryÂ spokesman confirmedÂ the death of 27 people, a NATO source told Reuters news agency that the death toll was slightly higher. More than 30 people were killed and 42 wounded, 20 of whom were in a serious condition, the agency reported.
The ISIL claimed it killed and injured 150 people, according to the groupâ€™s Amaq website, without providing evidence.
It is the deadliest attack since a peace deal was signed last week between the United States and the Taliban that aims for the complete withdrawal of US and NATO troops within 14 months.Â TheÂ warÂ in Afghanistan is theÂ longest one inÂ USÂ history, which continues for more than 18 years.
It was also one of the biggest attacks on civilians in Afghanistan in a year.
â€œThe attack started with a boom, apparently a rocket landed in the area, Abdullah and some other politicians â€¦ escaped the attack unhurt,â€ Fraidoon Kwazoon, Abdullahâ€™s spokesman, was quoted as saying by Reuters.
President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and called it â€œa crime against humanityâ€. He also said he had telephoned Abdullah, his longtime political rival who is contesting last monthâ€™s Electoral Commission announcement that declared Ghani the winner of Septemberâ€™s presidential election.

Broadcaster Tolo News showed live footage of people running for cover as gunfire was heard.
Al Jazeeraâ€™s Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Kabul, said a standoff between Afghan security forces and the attackers lasted for nearly six hours.Â 
The difficulty in quelling the attack â€œreally underlines that the Afghan security forces will be left in a fragile situationâ€ after the foreign troop withdrawal, Abdel-Hamid said.Â 
Meanwhile, the Taliban denied a role in the attack on the gathering marking the anniversary of the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, an ethnic Hazara leader who was killed in 1995 after being taken prisoner by Taliban fighters.
Despite the deal between the Taliban and the US, fighting has continued to rage across the country, casting a pall over hopes that the agreement would lead to a reduction in violence.
Several people were killed in a similar attack on the same commemoration last year. The ISIL had claimed responsibility for that attack also.



â€˜Weâ€™re sorry for those committing such crimesâ€™
Dozens of relatives gathered at the morgue of a hospital not far from the blast site, with many breaking down in tears as they waited to identify their loved ones.
Ambulances and stretchers bustled between the scene of the attack and the hospital to deliver the wounded for treatment.
â€œI was at the ceremony when gunshots started. I rushed towards the door to get out of the area but suddenly my foot was hit by a bullet,â€ Mukhtar Jan told Reuters from a stretcher at the hospital.
Ali Attayee, at the hospital to support his wounded brother, told the news agency: â€œThose who committed this crime want to destroy our people at this juncture in society, weâ€™re sorry for those committing such crimes.â€
Representatives of the US, the European Union and the NATOÂ condemned the attack.
â€œWe strongly condemn todayâ€™s vicious attackâ€¦We stand with Afghanistan for peace,â€ the US charge dâ€™affaires in Kabul, Ross Wilson, wrote on Twitter.

Horrific attack in Kabul today that led 2 tens of civilian casualties. Heartbreaking & unacceptable. We r tired of war & violence. @AfghanistanIHRC findings indicate more than 10,000 civilian casualties in 2019. First tangible step towards peace 4 Afgs would be ending d violence.

ShaharzadÂ Akbar, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, said:Â â€œHorrific attack in Kabul today â€¦ heartbreaking and unacceptable. We are tired of war and violence.â€
Hazaras are mostly Shia Muslims. Minority ShiasÂ have been repeatedly attacked by Sunni fighters in Afghanistan.

","The attackers shot at the ceremony from an under construction building.

Participants said that the attack was controversial and questionable.

The 25th death anniversary of Abdul Ali Mazari was held on Friday in PD^6, Kabul.

The attack charged when Karim Khalili, chair of the High Peace Council, started his speech.

Some political figures including Abdullah Abdullah, Hamid Karzai, and Mohammad Mohaqeq participated in the ceremony.

Karim Khalili said, “The government officials should clarify whether the people have the right to celebrate their leader or martyr.”

Pictures exclusive to Ariana News show that the insurgents were positioned at an under-construction building near the ceremony.

Few minutes after the attack, a special group of the US forces came to the scene to investigate the incident, and the Afghan Special Forces also started eliminating the insurgents.

The memorial ceremony of Mazari has been severally targeted by missile and suicide attacks.

The Taliban denied involvement  in the attack. No one has claimed responsibility for the incident so far.

According to primary reports from the Ministry of Public Health, 32 people were killed and 58 others were wounded in the attack.

Updated 3:40 p.m. ET: Gunmen opened fire on a memorial ceremony Friday in Kabul, killing at least 32 people and wounding dozens more in the first major attack in the Afghan capital since the U.S. signed a peace framework with the Taliban late last week. Several prominent politicians, including the country's chief executive and recent presidential candidate, Abdullah Abdullah, were in the audience but escaped unharmed. A spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of the Interior said the gunmen retreated to a nearby building, where they were killed during an hours-long standoff with security forces. An Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. The ceremony marked 25 years since the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, a leader of the country's Shiite minority, and the Sunni militant group that targeted a similar event last year. ""This situation looks endless in our country,"" one of the people injured in the attack told local media. ""There are political games, but only the poor people pay the price â€” how long will this continue?"" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he called Abdullah, his erstwhile rival for the presidency, and Karim Khalili, the chief of Afghanistan's high peace council. Khalili had been delivering an address at the ceremony when loud gunfire erupted, followed by screams. He emerged from the attack unscathed. 


""The attack is a crime against humanity and against the national unity of Afghanistan,"" Ghani said in a statement posted to Twitter.

For Afghans, the attack caps a bloody week across the country. Just six days ago, the U.S. and Taliban announced that they had signed an agreement, offering hope for peace between the two longtime adversaries. The deal outlined a 14-month timeline for the withdrawal of the thousands of Americans still stationed in Afghanistan, which would bring an end to the longest war in U.S. history. The U.S. troop drawdown is partly conditioned on the Taliban fulfilling their promises to combat and prevent the spread of terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaida.

But trouble quickly followed, as Ghani pushed back against the deal's proposal for a prisoner exchange, and the Taliban â€” after a seven-day reprieve â€” redoubled their deadly attacks on Afghan troops throughout the country. The violence escalated to the point that the U.S. said it carried out a ""defensive strike"" on the Taliban, seeking to support its Afghan allies at a military checkpoint earlier this week. Now Afghanistan must cope with yet another spasm of violence â€” this time in its capital, and so far with the assailants unknown. 


""We extend our condolences to the families of the victims & thank the Afghan security forces for swift response,"" Ross Wilson, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Kabul, tweeted. ""We stand with Afghanistan for peace.""

Attack on Kabul Rally Kills 32; Top Afghan Politicians Unhurt

Officials in Afghanistan say at least 32 people were killed and around 60 injured Friday when gunmen opened fire on a gathering in Kabul, with high-profile opposition politicians in attendance.
Witnesses said the shooting started when a former vice president, Karim Khalili, was delivering his speech to a ceremony in the Afghan capital, organized to commemorate the death of a prominent minority Shiâ€™ite Hazara politician. 
The event was being shown live by Afghan television stations and Khalili could be seen running for cover along with others when the gunfire erupted from a nearby under-construction building. 
There were women and children among those killed and injured, and Afghan health officials say they expect the death toll to increase.
Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said Afghan security forces later engaged three assailants and killed them in the ensuing hours-long clash to end the siege.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the deadly attack, saying two heavily armed men carried out the massacre. The Taliban insurgency swiftly denied its involvement. 
The Islamic State terror group's regional affiliate, known as Khorasan Province or ISKP, has claimed responsibility for previous attacks on Shiâ€™ite gatherings and worship places in Afghanistan.
Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah and former president Hamid Karzai were also among guest speakers at Fridayâ€™s gathering. Both of them escaped unharmed.
However, a former provincial governor was said to one among those wounded.
President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as a ""crime against humanity"", saying the violence was directed at Afghan national unity.
Last yearâ€™s commemoration of Abdul Ali Mazariâ€™s death anniversary, which is mostly attended by Shiâ€™ite Afghans, had also come under attack. About a dozen people were killed and many more were injured. That attack was claimed by Islamic State.
The ethnic Hazara leader was assassinated in 1995 after being taken hostage by militants when Afghanistan was in the grip of a deadly civil war.

US-Taliban deal
Fridayâ€™s violence comes nearly a week after the United States and the Taliban sealed a landmark peace agreement in Qatar to try to bring an end to the Afghan war, now in its 19th year.
The deal signed last Saturday, subject to Taliban counterterrorism and political assurances, set the stage for Washington to close Americaâ€™s longest war and bring back home in the next 14 months roughly 13,000 troops currently deployed to Afghanistan.

The U.S.-Taliban agreement binds Afghan parties to the conflict to open direct negotiations to agree on a permanent cease-fire and power-sharing in post-war Afghanistan. Those intra-Afghan talks are to begin on March 10, but they are facing uncertainty over a prisoner swap controversy.
Within 24 hours of the signing of the historic agreement, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced he had not given any commitment to Washington to free Taliban prisoners. 
The U.S.-Taliban deal, however, in the run-up to the intra-Afghan talks set for March 10, says that up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners being held in Afghan jails, and 1,000 Afghan forcesâ€™ members in insurgent custody, are to be freed by March 10. 
Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban political spokesman and a member of its negotiating team, said Friday if the intra-Afghan negotiations could not begin in time, the responsibility will rest with the other side.
""If the provisions of the agreements are implemented and prisoners are released, the Islamic Emirate [Taliban] is prepared for intra-Afghan negotiations on March 10. Our negotiation team and agenda are ready and will go ahead as agreed,â€ Shaheen stressed. 
The U.S.-Taliban agreement also requires both of the adversaries not to attack each othersâ€™ forces and binds the insurgent group not to carry out suicide and other bombings in Afghan urban centers.
There has been an upsurge in battlefield violence during this week, but U.S. military commanders have played it down and vowed to uphold their part of the deal.
""Of significance, there's no attacks in 34 provincial capitals. There's no attacks in Kabul. There's no high-profile attacks. There's no suicide bombers. There's no vehicle-borne suicide, no attack against U.S. forces, no attack against coalition. There's a whole laundry list of these things that arenâ€™t happening,â€ Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional hearing earlier this week.

It was unclear why the maternity hospital in Dashti Barchi, a 100-bed facility, was targeted â€“ an attack Arian said was an â€œact against humanity and a war crimeâ€.Â

At least three attackers wearing police uniforms entered the hospital,Â throwing grenades and shooting, officials said.

â€œThe hospital was full of patients and doctors, there was total panic inside,â€ the doctor said, asking not to be named.

In the evening hours, husbands, fathers and family members of the hospitalâ€™s patients gathered around the hospital, desperate for news of their loved ones.
A man read out the names of those who had been evacuated to other hospitals.
The neighbourhood is home to many members of Afghanistanâ€™s Hazara community, a mostly Shia Muslim minority that has been attacked by ISIL in the past, including at a Kabul ceremony commemorating the death of one of its leaders in March.
Rights group Amnesty International condemned both the attacks.
â€œThe unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today, targeting a maternity hospital and a funeral, must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face,â€ the group tweeted.
â€œThere must be accountability for these grave crimes.â€
Countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey and Pakistan released statements condemning the violence.
Deadly bombing
Also on Tuesday, in a suicide bombing in eastern Nangarhar province, an attacker targeted the Khewa-district funeral of a local pro-government militia commander and former warlord who had died of a heart attack on Monday night, said Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor.
The interior ministry said the final casualty toll included 24 killed and 68 wounded. The wounded were brought to the Nangarhar provincial hospital, said hospital spokesman Gulzada Sangar.
Khogyani added the dead included Abdullah Lala Jan, a provincial council member, while his father Noor Agha, a politician, was wounded in the attack.
According to Zabihullah Zemarai, another provincial council member, dozens of people, including, politicians, provincial council members and locals had gathered for the funeral of Shaikh Akram, the militia commander.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid tweeted that the Taliban was not involved in the attack.
ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack in Khost, which killed a child and wounded 10 people.
The bomb was placed in a cart at a local market and remotely detonated, said Adil Haidari, spokesman for the provincial police chief.
ISIL also said it was behind a spate of attacks on Monday in Kabul when four bombs, one placed under a garbage bin and the other three by the roadside, went off in the northern part of the city, wounding four civilians, including a child.
The Afghan intelligence service said in a statement late Monday that the agency arrested an ISIL leader in the region, Zia-ul Haq, also known as Shaikh Abu Omer al-Khorasani.
Afghanistan is also facing violence around the country from the Taliban, even as the United States tries to usher in peace talks after signing a troop withdrawal agreement in February with the armed group.
Taliban spokespeople say they are holding back from attacking urban centres and their operations are aimed at government security forces.

Afghanistan is reeling after a spasm of violence Tuesday left dozens of civilians dead across the country â€” including an assault in Kabul, where gunmen stormed a hospital's maternity ward and left at least 16 people dead. Among the victims in the Afghan capital were newborns, their mothers and the nurses who had been supporting them both. The attack in Kabul came within hours of another assault, this one more than 100 miles to the east in Nangarhar province, which left at least 24 people dead and dozens more injured after a suicide blast tore through a funeral. None of the active militant groups in the country immediately claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attacks. Through a spokesman, the Taliban specifically denied involvement in both assaults, saying of the funeral blast that it ""condemns such actions."" Even by the grim standards of a country that has seen more than four decades of violence, the attack on Dasht-e-Barchi hospital in western Kabul â€” better known by its nickname, ""The 100-Bed Hospital"" â€” proved particularly upsetting. ""Today's terrorist attack on a maternity hospital in Dasht-e-Barchi, Kabul is unforgivable,"" Marwa Amini, an interior ministry spokesperson, wrote on social media. ""Attacks on pregnant mothers, on sick people and on newborns that have new eyes to the world are not in any dictionary. Newborns breathe the first moments of life with the most horrific scenes. Shame on the terrorists."" 

Assailants opened their midmorning assault on the hospital with a suicide bombing. The gunmen proceeded to target the hospital's maternity section, which is operated by international aid group Doctors Without Borders, or MSF. 


Afghan police and special forces rushed to the scene, where they engaged in a firefight with the attackers, and government officials said the security forces managed to evacuate more than 100 people safely. Those rescued included a newborn who was rushed out of the hospital by a member of the Afghan special forces. The dramatic rescue was caught on video. Clad in a helmet and flak jacket, assault rifle slung over his shoulder, the man can be seen handing the tightly swaddled infant to medics in the back of an ambulance.

But even initial talks about talks were foundering because of disputes about prisoner release plans and intensifying Taliban violence in rural areas. Now hopes for progress towards ending a nearly two-decade long civil war look even dimmer.â€œThe reason to pursue peace is to end this senseless violence. This is not peace, nor its beginnings,â€ Ghaniâ€™s national security adviser, Hamdullah Mobib, said on Twitter.â€œIf the Taliban cannot control the violence, or their sponsors have now subcontracted their terror to other entities, which was one of our primary concerns from the beginning, then there seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in â€˜peace talksâ€™.â€The Taliban said they were not responsible for either attack, but have not condemned the bloodshed at the Kabul hospital.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, called the twin assaults â€œappallingâ€, adding: â€œThe Taliban and the Afghan government should cooperate to bring the perpetrators to justice.â€œAs long as there is no sustained reduction in violence and insufficient progress towards a negotiated political settlement, Afghanistan will remain vulnerable to terrorism.â€The morningâ€™s assault began with an explosion at the entrance to the 100-bed hospital in Dasht-e-Barchi, in the west of the capital, at about 10am local time. Three gunmen then burst inside and began shooting, apparently indiscriminately.â€œThey started firing as soon as they reached the doorstep,â€ one weeping doctor told Afghanistanâ€™s Tolo television, soon after escaping. â€œFour mothers were killed in the room, two were in a safe room and survived. It was a devastating scene.â€A reporter who was able to access the hospital soon after the attack said gunmen appeared to have opened fire in every room, and on everyone inside, with some bodies still lying in the recovery room where women are taken after giving birth.Husbands, brothers and fathers, who are not normally allowed on maternity wards in Afghanistan, thronged nearby streets in desperation, begging for news about whether their relatives had survived.â€œSixteen women and children were martyred and 16 other civilians were wounded in todayâ€™s barbaric terrorist attack,â€ said Feroz Bashiri, the director of government media and information centre.Afghan women sit in an ambulance after being rescued by security forces during the hospital attack. Photograph: Mohammad Ismail/ReutersMÃ©dicins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) confirmed it ran the maternity section of the hospital. â€œExplosions and gunfire were reported.

Hours earlier it shared a picture of a baby, safely delivered by emergency caesarean section at the clinic.The dead included mothers, nurses and infants, the interior ministry said, and officials shared a photo of two young children lying dead inside the hospital. About 100 people were rescued from the building, including three foreigners.The attack in Nangarhar province, eastern Afghanistan, targeted the funeral of a police commander who had died in the night of a heart attack, said Niloofar Aziz, a member of the provincial council.The explosion at about 11am killed one member of the council, Lala Khan. His father and brothers were among at least 68 injured. The scale of the casualties meant the death toll could rise, officials warned.â€œBecause it was a funeral of a high-profile man, many civilians were gathered there from other districts of Nangarhar. Among the people attending were MPs and members of the council,â€ Aziz said.The bomb devastated family groups who were mourning together. â€œThree of my nephews and one of my brothers were martyred,â€ one witness told state television. â€œHe was standing on my left, his name was Ismael. There was a rain of dead bodies.â€There was no immediate claim of responsibility from any other group. The neighbourhood to which the hospital belongs is home to a large community of Hazaras, a minority who are mostly Shia Muslims, and have frequently been targeted by Islamic State, including at a gym and a school.In March the regional Isis group also claimed responsibility for an attack on a Sikh temple in Kabul that killed dozens from the tiny religious minority group, including women and children.Later on Tuesday there was further violence in the eastern province of Khost, when a bomb planted in a cart in a market killed a child and wounded 10 other people.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/gunmen-attack-kabul-hospital-used-by-medecins-sans-frontieres

An attack on a mosque in Kabul during Friday prayers killed the imam and three worshipers and wounded several others.

Mawlawi Azizullah Mofleh, the imam of Sher Shah Suri mosque in the Kart e Char area, was a well-known religious scholar. 

This is the second attack on a religious scholar in the last 10 days. On June 2, Mawlawi Ayaz Niazi was killed in a similar attack at the Wazir Mohammad Akbar Khan mosque in downtown Kabul. The local chapter of Islamic State claimed responsibility for that.

An explosion occurred at Sher Shah Suri Mosque in Kart-e-Char area in the west of Kabul as people were partaking in the Friday prayer, 10 days after an explosion at a mosque in downtown Kabul left two dead and several others wounded.
Among the four killed was the imam of the mosque, Azizullah Mofleh, according to the Ministry of Interior Affairs.
The explosives were placed inside the mosque, the ministry said.
The explosion comes after an IED blast in Wazir Akbar Khan Mosque in downtown Kabul on June 2 in which the imam of the mosque, Mohammad Ayaz Niazi, was killed.

â€œExplosives placed inside the Sher Shah Suri Mosque exploded during Friday prayers,â€ said a statement issued by the ministry, which added that the mosqueâ€™s prayer leaderÂ Azizullah Mofleh was among those killed.
Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said police have cordoned off the area and helped move the wounded to ambulances and nearby hospitals.
Arian told Anadolu Agency that the incident took place in the posh Karta-4 neighbourhood of the city.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attackÂ but a mosque attack earlier this month was claimed by an ISIL (or ISIS) group affiliate, headquartered in eastern Afghanistanâ€™s Nangarhar province.
â€œInterestingly, every time you haveÂ the peace process gaining some momentumÂ and pace, you have theseÂ kinds of attacks in the country,â€Â Habib Wardak, a national security analyst based in Kabul, told Al Jazeera.
â€œThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack that happened last week on a mosque in Kabul, so despite the fact that you have these news and press conference from the government that they have eliminated ISIL, how can they conduct such sophisticatedÂ operations?â€
The Taliban was quick to distance itself from the attack.
In a social media post, the groupâ€™s spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahed, said this attack is part of conspiracy by the â€œenemyâ€ at a crucial time when peace talks are advancing.
The Afghan government dubbed the attackÂ  as â€œinhumanâ€ and â€œagainst the principles of Islam.â€
Stefano Pontecorvo, NATOâ€™s senior civilian representative in Kabul, stressed the perpetrators must be brought to justice.
â€œAs we face a historical opportunity for peace, spoilers canâ€™t be allowed to disrupt it. We stand with #Afghanistan in the fight against terror,â€ he said on Twitter.

â€œI strongly condemn the attack on Sher Shah Suri mosque. The perpetrators must be brought to justice. As we face a historical opportunity for peace, spoilers canâ€™t be allowed to disrupt it. We stand with #Afghanistan in the fight against terror.â€- #NATO SCR @pontecorvoste

Fridayâ€™s blast had parallels to one earlier this month, when an explosion tore apart a famous Kabul mosque and led to the death of renowned Afghan cleric Maulvi Ayaz Niazi.
â€œIn this attack, the imam seems to be the target, notÂ the rest of the crowd.Â These are the imamsÂ who have supportedÂ the peace process with the Taliban movement,â€ Wardak said.
â€œThe other political aspect for these kinds of attacks is that there are peace spoilers trying to convey a message that peace with the Taliban will not eradicate violence in the country because you have ISIL.â€

Violence has spiked in recent weeks in Afghanistan with most of the attacks claimed by the ISIL affiliate.
The United States blamed the armed group for a horrific attack last month on a maternity hospital in the capital that killed 24 people, including two infants and several new mothers.
The ISIL affiliate also took responsibility for an attack on a bus carrying journalists in Kabul on May 30, killing two.
It also claimed credit for an attack on the funeral of a strongman loyal to the government last month that killed 35 people.
Meanwhile, the US is attempting to broker peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban to end 18 years of war.
Washingtonâ€™s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was in the region earlier this week trying to resuscitate a US peace deal with the Taliban.
The peace deal signed in February calls for the withdrawal of the US and NATO troops from Afghanistan in return for a commitment by the Taliban to not launch attacks on the US or its allies.

At least 30 people were killed and over 70 were wounded outside an educational center in the western part of Kabul city on Saturday evening, a security official confirmed.Â 
The incident happened in the Pul-e-Khoshk area of Dasht-e-Barchi after a suicide bomber detonated explosives close to the center, according to officials.Â 
The Interior Ministry said that the suicide bomber was identified by security guards at the center and detonated his explosives before reaching his target.Â 
â€œMost of the victims are young and teenagers,â€ according to officials.Â 
The Taliban rejected involvement in the attack.Â 
Â The Kawsar educational center is located in a narrow street. The suicide bomber who was trying to enter the center was reportedly identified in the middle of the street in the west of Kabul, according to eyewitnesses.Â 
Eyewitnesses said dozens of students were in their classes when the attack happened. Â 
A number of nearby houses were also damaged in the attack.Â 
A funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday for the victims of the attack.Â 
The family of the victims have urged the government to undertake a â€œserious investigationâ€ into the attack.
Â 
A similar explosion happened in the west of Kabul in Â 2018, killing 48 students.Â 
The attack was widely condemned Â 
Condemnation of the attack Â 
US ChargÃ© dâ€™Affaires Ross Wilson condemned the Kabul attack, saying: ""Afghans want a peaceful future and reject this violence, and Americans stand with them.""Â 
Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council of National Reconciliation in a statement condemned the suicide attack, saying it is inhuman and against Islamic principles and values.Â 
Sharhzad Akbar, the chairperson of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, said: â€œAfter a week of horrific violence across Afghanistanâ€ the news on the attack â€œdrains every last ounce of energy and hope.â€ Â 
Pakistani envoy Mohammad Sadiq said Pakistan â€œcondemns in the strongest possible terms the inhuman terrorist attack outside an educational center in Kabul.â€Â 
â€œThis has been a deadly weekend for schoolchildren in Afghanistanâ€, UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a statement. Â 
â€œEarlier today, an attack outside an educational center in Kabulâ€™s Dasht-e-Barchi area left 16 people dead and 45 people injured, many of them women and children,â€ Fore said.
â€œAttacks on education are a grave violation of childrenâ€™s rights. Schools must be places of safety and learning, not death traps,â€ she added.
UNAMA condemned Saturday's blast, calling it ""a callous and senseless war crime,"" and the UN mission urged redoubled efforts to stem violence and focus on peace talks.

â€œMy friends and I were able to move around 15 wounded and nine dead bodies from the explosion site â€¦ Other bodies were lying under chairs and tables inside the classroom,â€ he said.
Further details of the attack were not immediately available, although the official death toll was expected to rise.
Ethnic Hazara have alleged years of persecution by the ruling Taliban, which returned to power in the country following the withdrawal of United States-led forces in August 2021, and have been the victims of several attacks claimed by the rival ISIL (ISIS) group.

The Dasht-e-Barchi neighbourhood has witnessed some of the worst attacks in Afghanistan in recent years.
In 2021, before the Taliban takeover, at least 85 people â€“ mostly female students â€“ were killed and about 300 others wounded when three bombs exploded near their school in Dasht-e-Barchi.
No group claimed responsibility for that attack, but a year earlier, ISIL claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on an educational centre in the same area that killed 24, including students.
In April of this year, two deadly bomb blasts at separate education centres in the area killed six people and wounded 20 others.
â€˜Shamefaced reminderâ€™
Since taking control, the Taliban government has emphasised that it is securing the nation following decades of war, but a series of attacks on mosques and civilian areas in recent months has challenged that narrative.
In the wake of the attacks, Samira Hamidi, Amnesty Internationalâ€™s South Asia campaigner, decried the killings as a â€œshamefaced reminder of the inaptitude and utter failure of the Taliban, as de-facto authorities, to protect the people of Afghanistanâ€.
â€œSince their takeover of Afghanistan, the Taliban have done little to put in place any measures for the protection of the public, especially of Shia-Hazaras who have been systematically targeted largely by the Islamic State (IS) in schools, mosques, training centers and public places,â€ she said in a statement.
â€œInstead, their actions of omission and commission have only further aggravated the risk to the lives of the people of Afghanistan especially those belonging to ethnic and minority communities.â€
Education also remains a flashpoint issue in Afghanistan with the Taliban blocking many girls from returning to secondary education.
On Friday, Neil Turner, the Norwegian Refugee Councilâ€™s Country Director in Afghanistan, called on authorities â€œto take steps to ensure that educational facilities are protected against threats and attacks so that girls and boys can fully enjoy their education rightsâ€.

The building in the predominantly Shia Muslim Dasht-e-Barchi area usually hosts hundreds of students.

The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack.

It did not provide any evidence to back up its claim issued via its usual social media outlets.

One of its members detonated an explosives vest among a gathering of Shias, it said, while using a disparaging term for the religious community.

The Shia community in Afghanistan has previously been targeted by Sunni Muslim extremists such as IS, which views the Shia practice of Islam as heretical.

Earlier, the Taliban denied involvement in the attack.

""A suicide bomber wanted to enter the education centre,"" interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said in a statement, AFP news agency reports.

The spokesman added that the attacker was spotted by security guards ""after which he detonated his explosives in an alley"".One local resident, Ali Reza, told AFP that those killed and injured were students waiting to enter the facility. ""I was standing about 100m from the centre when a big blast knocked me down,"" he said.

Afghanistan has seen a rise in violence in recent weeks - with most of the attacks carried out by the Taliban. The violence threatens to imperil peace talks between government forces and the Taliban in the Qatari capital, Doha.Saturday's attack is not the first to target an education centre in the country.

Forty-eight people - many of them teenagers - were killed in August 2018 when a suicide bomber walked into a tuition facility and detonated a device while teaching was under way. The Islamic State group said it was behind that attack.

And in May, 24 women, children and babies were killed when unidentified gunmen entered a maternity ward at a hospital in Kabul and opened fire.

Earlier this week, 11 children and their prayer leader died an air strike on a religious school in the northern Afghan province of Takhar, according to local officials. The Afghan government disputed the account, saying the strike had killed Taliban fighters.

As Afghan peace talks crawl along in Doha, a brutal attack on a school in Kabul on Saturday underscored the terrible toll the conflict continues to take on civilians.
A massive suicide bombing on October 24 outside the Kawsar-e Danish educational center in west Kabul was the latest attack cruelly targeting the Hazara Shia minority. The explosion took place in a crowded, narrow street outside the center, killing 30 people and injuring more than 70, mostly children and young adults between 15 and 26 years old who were attending classes.
Since 2017, the Dasht-e Barchi neighborhood, home to a predominantly Hazara community, has seen numerous attacks on civilians. A bombing at the Imam Zaman mosque in October 2017 killed 39; an attack on a school in August 2018 killed more than 34 students; and twin bombings at a wrestling club in September 2018 killed 20, including journalists and first responders who arrived after the first explosion. In May, gunmen murdered 15 women in the maternity wing of the Dasht-e Barchi hospital, many of whom were in labor or had just given birth.
The Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), the Afghan branch of the Islamic State (ISIS), claimed responsibility for Saturdayâ€™s attack. The armed group has claimed responsibility for many such bombings and has long singled out Afghanistanâ€™s Hazara Shia community for attack. Intentional attacks on civilians are grave violations of the laws of war, and those responsible should be prosecuted for war crimes.
Many mosques and educational facilities in Kabul now have armed guards, but this offers little protection from such calculated attacks. Afghan authorities repeatedly promise investigations, including tasking the attorney generalâ€™s war crimes unit to carry them out, but none have yielded results, leaving family members of victims with neither answers nor justice.â€œThey are killing our youth,â€ said the relative of one of the victims of Saturdayâ€™s attack. The students, many from poor families who, as one of their teachers said, had come to Kabul in hope â€œfor a brighter future.â€ On Sunday they were buried.

Updated 6:18 AM ET Sunday Officials in Afghanistan say at least 24 people are dead, including schoolchildren, from a suicide attack outside of an education center in the capital of Kabul. The country's interior ministry confirmed that more than 57 others were wounded Saturday after the explosion went off in a heavily Shiite neighborhood, The Associated Press reported.  Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said the attacker attempted to enter the center but was stopped by security guards, according to the AP. The attacker then set off the explosives in a nearby alley, the Agence France-Presse reported.  Reuters, citing Arian, identified the target of the attack as the Kawsar-e Danish education center. The center offers training and courses for higher education students, the AFP says.    The western Kabul neighborhood where the bombing occurred has a large Shiite community, a minority group in the country that has been targeted by the Islamic State in the past.  The Islamic State took responsibility for the attack, though it did not provide any evidence, Reuters reported. The Taliban has denied responsibility for the bombing. 


The attack came amid intensifying fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban, even as the two sides engage in peace talks. Those talks were spurred by a peace deal agreed to by the U.S. and the Taliban in February that would pave for the way for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country. Amnesty International said Friday that at least 50 civilians were killed in the past week in spite of the ongoing peace talks.  The Associated Press reported that a separate attack in eastern Afghanistan on Saturday killed nine people after a roadside bomb struck a minivan full of civilians. A second roadside bomb killed two policemen who were en route to respond.

Blast Kills Students At Kabul Educational Center
","
Updated

October 24, 2020

","Based on reporting by AFP, dpa, AP, and RFE/RL's Radio Free Afghanistan","
Afghan officials say at least 18 people have been killed in a suicide bombing that struck outside an educational center in Kabul's Dasht-e Barchi district.
Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said at least 57 people were wounded in the attack on October 24 that was claimed by the Islamic State extremist group. The casualty figures could still rise, he added.
The bomber had tried to enter the Kawsar center but blew himself up as he was approached by security guards, Arian said in a statement.
The center offers training and courses for students in higher education in the mainly Shi'ite Hazara-dominated area in a western district of Kabul. 
The AFP news agency quoted eyewitness Ali Reza as saying that most of the victims were students.
""I was standing about 100 meters from the center when a big blast knocked me down,"" he said. ""Dust and smoke were all around me. All those killed and wounded were students who wanted to enter the center.""
The suicide attack came hours after a roadside bomb tore through a bus east of Kabul, killing nine civilians. Government officials blamed that explosion on the Taliban.
Violence continues in the country even as representatives from the government and the Taliban engage in peace talks in Doha to end the decades-long war in Afghanistan.
On October 23, rights watchdog Amnesty International said at least 50 people had been killed in Afghanistan in attacks in the preceding week. The group accused both the Taliban and the government of failing to protect civilians.

â€œMy friends and I were able to move around 15 wounded and nine dead bodies from the explosion site â€¦ Other bodies were lying under chairs and tables inside the classroom,â€ he said.
Further details of the attack were not immediately available, although the official death toll was expected to rise.
Ethnic Hazara have alleged years of persecution by the ruling Taliban, which returned to power in the country following the withdrawal of United States-led forces in August 2021, and have been the victims of several attacks claimed by the rival ISIL (ISIS) group.

The Dasht-e-Barchi neighbourhood has witnessed some of the worst attacks in Afghanistan in recent years.
In 2021, before the Taliban takeover, at least 85 people â€“ mostly female students â€“ were killed and about 300 others wounded when three bombs exploded near their school in Dasht-e-Barchi.
No group claimed responsibility for that attack, but a year earlier, ISIL claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on an educational centre in the same area that killed 24, including students.
In April of this year, two deadly bomb blasts at separate education centres in the area killed six people and wounded 20 others.
â€˜Shamefaced reminderâ€™
Since taking control, the Taliban government has emphasised that it is securing the nation following decades of war, but a series of attacks on mosques and civilian areas in recent months has challenged that narrative.
In the wake of the attacks, Samira Hamidi, Amnesty Internationalâ€™s South Asia campaigner, decried the killings as a â€œshamefaced reminder of the inaptitude and utter failure of the Taliban, as de-facto authorities, to protect the people of Afghanistanâ€.
â€œSince their takeover of Afghanistan, the Taliban have done little to put in place any measures for the protection of the public, especially of Shia-Hazaras who have been systematically targeted largely by the Islamic State (IS) in schools, mosques, training centers and public places,â€ she said in a statement.
â€œInstead, their actions of omission and commission have only further aggravated the risk to the lives of the people of Afghanistan especially those belonging to ethnic and minority communities.â€
Education also remains a flashpoint issue in Afghanistan with the Taliban blocking many girls from returning to secondary education.
On Friday, Neil Turner, the Norwegian Refugee Councilâ€™s Country Director in Afghanistan, called on authorities â€œto take steps to ensure that educational facilities are protected against threats and attacks so that girls and boys can fully enjoy their education rightsâ€.

At least three people were killed in a magnetic IED blast in Char Qala in downtown Kabul on Tuesday afternoon, Kabul police said. Â 
Police said 10 others were wounded in the explosion, which occurred in police district 10 (PD10). Â 
The mine was placed on a Toyota Corolla-model car, the police reported.Â 
All the victims were civilians, police said.Â 
This comes after an explosion killed 30 people, mostly students, at an education center in the west of Kabul this weekend. Â 
Civilian Casualties Â 
The UN mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) report released on Tuesday said that overall the civilian casualty figure for the first nine months of 2020 dropped by around 30 percent compared to the same period in 2019, but while the number of civilian casualties is lowest in the first nine months of any year since 2012, â€œthe harm done to civilians remains inordinate and shocking.â€ Â 
""High levels of violence continue with a devastating impact on civilians, with Afghanistan remaining among the deadliest places in the world to be a civilian,"" the report said.Â 
â€œThe peace talks will need some time to help deliver peace. But all parties can immediately prioritize discussions and take urgent, and frankly overdue, additional steps to stem the terrible harm to civilians,â€ said Deborah Lyons, the Secretary-Generalâ€™s Special Representative for Afghanistan in the report. Â 
â€œNew thinking and concrete action towards safeguarding civilian life will not only save thousands of families from suffering and grief but it can also help lessen recriminations and, instead, bolster confidence and trust among negotiators,â€ said Lyons, who is also head of UNAMA. Â 
UNAMA reported that Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) remain responsible for the majority of civilian casualties (58 per cent). Compared to the same period in 2019, the amount of civilian deaths attributed to AGEs remained at similar levels, although there was a decrease of 34 per cent in the total number of civilian casualties â€“ killed and injured â€“ attributed to AGEs, said the report.Â

Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz said two explosions caused by sticky bombs attached to vehicles took place 15 minutes apart and a third targeting a police vehicle exploded about two hours later.

No group immediately claimed responsibility.

The majority of bomb attacks in the capital Kabul in recent months have been sticky bombs — explosive devices with magnets that are attached to vehicles and detonated by remote control or timer.The second explosion targeted a car in a northwestern Kabul neighborhood in which national army soldiers were traveling, killing two soldiers. A civilian passerby was also killed.

The third explosion destroyed a police car in western Kabul killing two police officers. Meanwhile, the first blast targeted a civilian car wounding both travelers inside the vehicle.

Kabul police said investigations were underway.

The Islamic State group’s local affiliate has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, but many go unclaimed, with the government putting the blame on the Taliban. The insurgents have denied responsibility for most of the attacks.

Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled. It’s been over a month since the sides last met to discuss how to proceed.

Meanwhile, the new U.S. administration is reviewing the U.S.-Taliban peace deal signed Feb. 29 last year. A major part of the agreement was Washington’s commitment to a May 1 withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan.

Russia has stepped up efforts to try and find a way forward, visiting with regional players and officials and senior Taliban figures.

Zamir Kabulov, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy for Afghanistan, met with Pakistani officials, including army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, on Friday to discuss the peace process. Pakistan is seen as a key player in the Afghanistan peace process since Taliban leadership maintains homes and headquarters in Pakistan,

Scenes from Sayed ul-Shuhada High School in Kabul, Afghanistan, where as many as 85 people including many schoolgirls were killed in an attack this weekend, should break anyoneâ€™s heart. They certainly broke mine. In 2017 a filmmaker and I spent a week at the school, filming a video to accompany a report on barriers to girlsâ€™ education.
The school had difficulties providing girls an education. Girls studied outdoors, in tattered tents or the open air, and the school was desperately overcrowded. Girls lacked essential facilities such as toilets and a library, and faced hardships outside school, too.
Their neighborhood is very impoverished, populated predominantly by members of Afghanistanâ€™s Hazara minority. It has increasingly been targeted for attack, including on a local maternity hospital in May 2020. Families were often unable to afford transportation and many girls walked 45 minutes or more to get there. Many worked in addition to studying, at jobs such as carpet-making and tailoring, to support their families.

But what shone through was the girlsâ€™ determination to study no matter what. In a country where less than 30 percent of women can read, these girls bring hope for a brighter future. They were funny and lively, like girls anywhere, but also deadly serious about getting an education. This makes their senseless killing so particularly devastating.
This is a perilous moment for Afghanistan. All US troops are slated to leave the country by September 11, 2021; other NATO troops are going too.
A devastating picture of what lies ahead is emerging, one of rising violence and likely increased Taliban control, both of which will disproportionately harm women and girls. Intensifying fighting may also bring more atrocities by the Afghan branch of the Islamic State (ISIS), which has been behind many of the attacks on Hazaras. Recent months have brought attacks on female journalists and other high-profile women.
US President Joe Biden has called â€œthe end of Americaâ€™s longest warâ€ an accomplishment. But the war has in no way ended, and its front line yet again reached the gates of a girlsâ€™ school. The US and other countries withdrawing troops should understand that their responsibility to Afghan girls and women is not finished. They should assist efforts to investigate and ensure accountability for this and other unlawful attacks on civilians, and support safe access to essential services like education for everyone.

For the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood of Kabul, home to the Hazara minority group, the devastating May 8 bombing outside a school is part of a disturbing trend of attacks in the area. The bombing killed at least 85 and injured around 150 â€” mostly young girls â€” and coincided with concerns of escalating violence as the United States withdraws combat troops from Afghanistan. Although no group has claimed responsibility, the Islamic State group (ISIS) has perpetrated similar attacks in the past and many suspect it was again responsible.Â

USIPâ€™s Belquis Ahmadi and Fatema Ahmadi look at the implications of this attack on the peace process, how it has impacted the Hazara community and what the United States and international community can do to help protect the gains Afghan women and minorities have made in the last 20 years.
Although attacks like this are all too commonplace in Afghanistan, what is the significance of the May 8 bombing amid the withdrawal of foreign troops?
Belquis: The bombing of the Sayed Al-Shuhada school in Dasht-e-Barchi in West Kabul was deliberate, coordinated and planned for maximum impact. It targeted young Hazara girls in a neighborhood where the majority of households live below the poverty line.Â Although no group claimed responsibility for the attack, and the Taliban denied involvement, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani laid blame on the militant group, saying it demonstrated they did not earnestly seek a political settlement to Afghanistanâ€™s conflict. In recent years, ISIS has claimed responsibility for these types of attacks on Hazaras.
The attack on girl students demonstrates the vulnerability of religious and ethnic minorities as Afghan security forces are spread thin in the fight against the Taliban while foreign troops withdraw. The increased violence in the country affects all Afghansâ€™ lives, but especially women and children. Attacks on civilians demonstrate that the Taliban and other terrorist groups will continue to use violence to achieve their aims. By attacking schools, these spoilers want to take away girlsâ€™ right to education.
If there is a lesson to be learned from this tragic incident and other past attacks, it is that Afghan girls continue to demonstrate their resiliency by going to schools and universities, even if it means risking their lives.
What, if any, implications are there for the peace process?
Belquis: Rising violence will further undermine and complicate the peace process. Local communities, particularly religious and ethnic groups, will likely take matters into their own hands. The Hazara community in particular has been targeted repeatedly by ISIS and feels that government security forces have not done enough to protect them. There is an emergent incentive among some Afghan groups to establish self-defense militias, which could lead to greater political fragmentation and has disturbing echoes of the ethnic factionalism that drove the 1990s civil war. Former warlords, local militia commanders and new groups have begun arming their supporters in preparation for a much-deteriorated security situation.
More violence will reduce the chances for peace or reconciliation. Generally speaking, the Taliban benefit from ethnic divisions within the Afghanistan republic. The more united a party is in a peace process, the more power they have at the table. Both the Afghan government and Taliban are seeking to divide their opponents. But the Taliban are a more homogeneous group, which makes their task easier.
On the other hand, the issue of education does unite different factions within the Afghan republic.Â  Different regions of the country have different attitudes toward girlsâ€™ education, but there is a strong national consensus outside of Taliban circles that all girls should have access to education. The bombing is seen by most Afghans as an atrocity and as an unacceptable attack on girlsâ€™ right to education.
If the Taliban continue to ignore calls for a cease-fire, they are undermining their own cause. Indeed, the Taliban hated their pariah status prior to the U.S.-Taliban agreement and now enjoy being seen as respectable interlocutors. The international community could decide to oppose further prisoner releases, stop engaging the Taliban at senior diplomatic levels and keep U.N. sanctions in place if they continue to enable attacks and deny women and girls their basic rights, including the right to equal education.
Can you explain what the situation is like on the ground and how this attack has reverberated throughout the Hazara community?
Fatema: These kinds of attacks reinforce the idea among the minority Hazara ethnic group that itâ€™s facing an ethnic cleansing campaign, or that there is a lack of concern from the Afghan state over their wellbeing. For example, the principal of the Sayed Al-Shuhada school requested months ago that the Ministry of Education help provide armed guards amid threats and other educational centers in the area being attacked. Hazara activists are sharing on social media related stories, scenarios, political speeches and past experiences to show that there is a link between the school attacks in West Kabul and systematic discrimination against the Hazara community more broadly throughout the country.
The attack has also led to increased fears of vulnerability among Hazaras as international forces withdraw. Hazaras â€” a Shia, Dari-speaking minority ethnic group in Afghanistan â€” have long been persecuted by the Taliban. Like other minority groups, Hazaras saw international troops as a buffer against militant attacks. But many now feel abandoned.
How can the United States and international community help limit such attacks and preserve the gains women have made over the last two decades in the absence of a large military footprint?
Belquis: The Afghanistan of today is very different than the Afghanistan of 20 years ago. The Taliban canâ€™t just expect to take over and impose their anachronistic worldview on Afghans like they did in the 1990s. But honoring the sacrifices and hard work of Afghan men and women to assert their constitutional, social, political and economic rights equates with protecting the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its constitutional order that enabled the hard-won gains.
A top priority will, therefore, be to support the Afghan government, and the Afghan National Security Forces (ANDSF) in particular, to prevent major and rapid Taliban military gains that could create a domino effect leading to the collapse of the government. This requires the United States to keep NATO allies engaged and to maintain robust levels of military assistance for support to ANDSF against major Taliban offensives.
The attack on the school in West Kabul shows how the Talibanâ€™s insurgency creates a vector for terrorist atrocities by a variety of groups. Because the Taliban keep the ANDSF on their heels and create ungoverned spaces, it provides its own militants and other terrorist groups with ample opportunity to attack Afghan forces and civilian targets. The 2018 Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocity Prevention Act calls for U.S. government efforts to â€œenhance the capacity of the United States to prevent and respond to atrocities worldwide.â€ In this vein, even as the U.S. troop presence dwindles, the United States should use whatever leverage it can to prevent mass killings like the May 8 bombing from happening again.
There is a larger lesson for the United States and Afghanistanâ€™s neighbors as well: If the war is not controlled, and a political solution is not reached, the next target can be Islamabad or Washington or London, not an Afghan girlsâ€™ school in Kabul.
None of Afghanistanâ€™s neighbors or regional actors want to see the restoration of an Islamic emirate, or a descent into civil war. The â€œTroika Plusâ€ (the United States, Russia, China and Pakistan) issued a strong statement in this regard, and the Iranians have also repeatedly made this clear in official statements.
The U.S.-led Afghan peace process has done a great deal to legitimize the Taliban, which the Taliban are adept at leveraging, and which they value tremendously. International messaging should continue to focus on the fact that if the Taliban have dominance in potential power-sharing arrangements, and try to oppress Afghan citizens, especially women and minorities, they will quickly regain pariah status.
Finally, the deteriorating security situation combined with the devastating impact of the drought will require significantly more resources and preparation for humanitarian response programming in both government- Â and Taliban-controlled areas. This means committing new money and not simply releasing the $300 million that the United States had already committed but then withheld, as well as having the World Bank convene a donor conference to discuss funding priorities that major donors should support, and the best mechanisms to provide support.

According to news reports,Â scores ofÂ peopleÂ â€“Â many of themÂ studentsÂ betweenÂ the ages ofÂ 11 and 15Â â€“Â were killed andÂ hundreds of others injured.Â 
SafeguardÂ girlsÂ educationÂ 
TheÂ UN officialsÂ alsoÂ calledÂ onÂ theÂ AfghanÂ authorities to urgently protect the right to education in armed conflict, especiallyÂ forÂ girls,Â which is too often overlooked and neglected.Â 
â€œIn many contexts, access to education is particularly harsh for girls for economic and cultural reasons, but also for security reasons of which the recent attack in Afghanistan is only one latest tragic exampleâ€, they said, pushing for the safety ofÂ schoolsÂ â€œand that girls just like boys are given equal opportunities to pursue their educationâ€.Â 
Afghanistan schoolsÂ targetedÂ 
AfghanistanÂ schools and hospitalsÂ remain one of the most attacked, according toÂ theâ€¯2019 Secretary-General Report on Children and Armed Conflict. AndÂ preliminary data for 2020 show a similar worrying trend, with COVID-19 further exacerbating the vulnerabilities of children, including girls.Â 
â€œGirls may not be given the choice to go back to school when they reopen, because they had to work or be married off to support their familiesâ€, said the two UN officials.Â Â 
Against the backdropÂ of theÂ unremittingÂ challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,Â they stressed that â€œcountries must make the strategic decision of prioritizing education, including in armed conflict in line with the Sustainable Development GoalsÂ (SDGs)Â ofÂ reaching the furthest behindâ€.Â 
Undermining women's rolesÂ 
Targeting girls undermines the crucial role that educated girls and womenÂ playÂ in the social and economic developmentÂ ofÂ their societies.Â

Two bombs exploded in quick succession in separate locations of a west Kabul neighborhood late on Tuesday, killing at least 10 people and wounding a dozen others, said deputy Interior Ministry spokesman Said Hamid Rushan.
A third bomb heavily damaged an electric grid station in north Kabul, said Sangar Niazai, a spokesman for the government power supply department.
The initial two bombings, both targeting minivans, happened in a mostly ethnic Hazara area of the capital, said Rushan.
The first exploded near the home of a prominent Hazara leader, Mohammad Mohaqiq, and in front of a Shia mosque. Most Hazaras are Shia Muslims. The second bomb also targeted a minivan but Rushan said details were still being collected.
Police cordoned off the two areas and investigators were sifting through the rubble.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombings. The ISIL (ISIS) affiliate operating in Afghanistan has previously declared war on minority Shia Muslims, who make up roughly 20 percent of the majority Sunni Muslim nation of 36 million people.
 




 


 
The ISIL affiliate previously claimed responsibility for several attacks in May on Afghanistanâ€™s power supply stations in Kabul and in several other provinces.
On May 8, a car bomb and two roadside bombs exploded outside the Syed-al-Shahada girls school, also in a predominantly Hazara neighborhood, killing nearly 90 people, many of them students. No one has claimed that attack but the US blamed ISIL.

(Last Updated On: June 4, 2021)Ariana News and Ariana television female anchor Mina Khairi and her mother have been killed in Thursday eveningâ€™s blast in the west of Kabul.
The Afghan authorities confirmed through DNA tests that two of the victims of the Kabul blast were Khairi and her mother.
According to Khairiâ€™s family members, Minaâ€™s sister, who has also sustained serious injuries in the explosion, is currently hospitalized for treatment.
Mina Khairi started working as a presenter and announcer of radio and television programs in May 2017 with Ariana News and Ariana.
The blast took place in the Pul-e-Sokhta area in PD6 in the west of Kabul city on Thursday evening.
At least four civilians were killed and five others wounded in the explosion.
This comes amid a surge in explosions targeting civilians in the western parts of Kabul city in the past few days.
Meanwhile, the Reporters without Borders (RSF) has formally asked the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate murders of journalists and media workers in Afghanistan since March 2020.
RSF has asked Bensouda to investigate these murders â€“ which the organization said Wednesday could be regarded as war crimes â€“ under article 15 of the ICCâ€™s Rome statute.
The latest media victims were three women working for Enekaas TV in the eastern city of Jalalabad, who were gunned down while on their way home on 2 March.
Before that, Voice of Ghor radio station director Besmellah Adel Imaq was shot dead as he was returning home in Firoz Koh, the capital of the central province of Ghor, on 1 January.
Imaq was the fifth media worker to be killed in the space of two months.
The others were Mohammad Aliyas Dayee of Radio Free Europe/Radio Libertyâ€™s Pashto-language service, who was murdered in Lashkargah on 12 November; Malalai Maiwand, a TV presenter and representative of the Centre for the Protection of Afghan Women Journalists (CPAWJ), and her driver Taher Khan, who were murdered in Jalalabad on 10 December; and Rahmatollah Nekzad, a reporter for international media, who was gunned down in Ghazni on 21 December.
All of these journalists and media workers were targeted because of their work amid an armed conflict that has seen an increase in violence against journalists and civil society in general since early 2020, RSF said in a statement.
â€œRSF has every reason to believe that armed groups, especially the Taliban or Taliban affiliates, are responsible for this wave of killings,â€ the organization stated.
â€œRSF has asked the ICCâ€™s chief prosecutor to include these murders in the crimes committed in Afghanistan since 2003 that she was authorized to investigate by the ICCâ€™s Appeals Chamber in March 2020.
â€œWith a view to prosecuting those responsible, RSF has asked her to determine whether they should be treated as war crimes or as another category of crimes defined by the ICCâ€™s Rome Statute, such as crimes against humanity,â€ the organization stated.
At least 100 journalists, including 15 foreign journalists, have been killed in connection with their work in the past 20 years in Afghanistan, while more than 60 media outlets have been destroyed or attacked and hundreds of threats have been made against journalists and media.

Mina Khairi, a presenter at Ariana News, and her mother are among the victims of Thursday afternoonâ€™s blast in Kabul that killed four people, the head of the Ariana News, Sharif Hassanyar, confirmed.Â 
Minaâ€™s sister was wounded in the incident.
She went home from the office on Thursday and then went outside with her mother and sister to buy food. They took a minivan and were on their way home when the blast happened.Â Â 
The blast happened at around 1:45 pm local time in Chahar Qala area Kabulâ€™s District 6, targeting a small bus.
Six more civilians, including two women and a child, were wounded in the explosion.
Four more civilians were killed in another in the west of Kabul on the same day. Five more civilians were wounded in the blast.
Mina Khairi, 23, worked for Ariana and Ariana News for five years.Â 
â€œShe studied. She made efforts and wanted to serve her countryâ€¦ But the fate of these youth is under the control of those who claim to do jihad in this country,â€ said Yusuf, Minaâ€™s uncle.
â€œWe will continue our activities. Freedom of speech was a red line for Mina Khairi and was one of her wishes and we will continue her path,â€ said Sharif Hassanyar, head of Ariana News.
Three members of another family were also killed in the two blasts west of Kabul on Thursday.
â€œIt is impossible to tolerate this pain. What was the sin of the two innocent children and the woman who were killed (in the blasts)?â€ asked Fraidoon, brother of a victim.
Meanwhile, Mohammad Mohaqiq, a senior presidential adviser, said on a Facebook post that the president has rejected a national and people-oriented plan for the security of the west of Kabul.
But the Second Vice President Mohammad Sarwar Danesh said the recent killings in the west of Kabul are organized, reiterating that the security agencies should either the plan prepared by the people for the west of Kabul or they should prepare a proper plan to ensure the safety of the residents of western Kabul.
â€œSecurity agencies and those who are in the government are directly responsible for ensuring the safety of the people. They must act promptly against the repeated killings and the â€˜genocideâ€™ in the west of Kabul and they should be responsive for the people,â€ Danesh said.
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission also called for an end to the killing of civilians.
â€œWe call on the international community to fulfill its moral and legal responsibility towards the protection of the rights of Afghan citizens and end of the war so that human rights are not violated anymore,â€ said Zabihullah Farhang, head of the media office of the commission.
This comes as TOLOnews anchor Nemat Rawan was killed in an attack by unknown armed men in Kandahar on May 7.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, at least 11 human rights defenders and media workers were killed in targeted attacks in Afghanistan from September 2020 to January 31, 2021.
A total of 65 human rights defenders and media professionals were killed in the period from January 1, 2018, to January 31, 2021, the report said.

The explosions on Saturday hit vehicles on the same road about 2 kilometres (1.25 miles) apart in a western Kabul neighbourhood largely populated by members of the ethnic Hazara minority.
One of the blasts killed six people and wounded two, the interior ministry said. The other, which took place in front of Muhammad Ali Jinnah hospital, killed one and wounded four.
Hazaras, who are mostly Shia Muslims, have long suffered oppression and persecution in mostly Sunni Afghanistan â€“ and were more recently targeted by ISIL-linked fighters.
An attack on a Kabul school on May 8 killed nearly 100 people, all of them Hazara and most of them young girls just leaving class.
It was not immediately clear what type of explosives were used and no one immediately claimed responsibility for Saturdayâ€™s attacks. The local affiliate of ISIL (ISIS) has carried out similar bombings in the area, including four attacks on four minivans earlier this month that killed at least 18 people.

Violence and chaos continue to escalate in Afghanistan as the United States and NATO continue their withdrawal of the remaining 2,500-3,500 US soldiers and 7,000 allied forces. The last of the troops will be gone by September 11 at the latest.
Also on Saturday, a magnetic bomb placed in a bicycle was detonated in the provincial capital of the northern province of Balkh, killing at least one civilian and wounding three others, provincial police spokesman Adel Shah Adel said.
Since the beginning of the official withdrawal of the US and other NATO troops on May 1, at least 17 districts have fallen to the hands of Taliban.
On Saturday, the armed groupâ€™s fighters took control of Tolak district in the countryâ€™s central province of Ghor following heavy clashes with members of government forces,
More than a dozen members of government forces were killed while several others were wounded in the overnight clashes, member of parliament Keramuddin Reza Zada told dpa news agency.
In the countryâ€™s northern province of Balkh, Taliban fighters took control of Zara district after forcing members of the government forces to evacuate the district centre, two local officials said.
The security forces evacuated the district without any casualties with the help of the air force, provincial councillor Afzal Hadid said, adding that the area had been under siege for a long time.

On 15 June, five health workers were killed and four others injured after gunmen opened fire at various polio vaccination centres across the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province. The incident comes shortly after two car bombs killed at least seven civilians and injured at least six others in a district of Western Kabul largely populated by members of the persecuted Hazara minority on 12 June.

“The targeting of civilians with near total impunity continues unabated. While peace talks falter and preparations for the full withdrawal of international forces gathers pace, it’s Afghanistan’s civilians who are paying the brutal price of this conflict,” said Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner.

“The Afghan authorities must end this cycle of impunity by launching independent and effective investigations into these and other attacks on civilians and bring those responsible to justice. We urge all parties to the conflict to take all measures necessary to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law. And we call on the international community to make the protection of civilians and of minorities a central component of their ongoing support of the peace process.”

The targeting of civilians with near total impunity

Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner
The incidents this week follow the killing of 10 mine clearers, many of whom were Hazara, working for the international humanitarian organization The Halo Trust in Baghlan province on 8 June, in an attack that injured 16 others.

Health workers, humanitarians, human rights defenders and journalists have been particularly targeted in a wave of assassinations since the start of peace talks in Doha last year. At least 24 have been killed since January 2021, including two doctors in separate attacks in Parwan and Farah provinces in the past week. With the exception of one of the killings, no other investigations have taken place, and nobody has been brought to justice in any of the cases.

This week’s attack on the polio vaccination centres in Jalalabad, which caused the vaccination drive to be suspended in Eastern Afghanistan, follows a similar attack in March which left three health workers in Nangarhar dead. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two countries in the world where polio remains endemic. 

“In recent months we have seen appalling attacks on schoolchildren, health workers, humanitarians and other civilians in busy streets and markets. Deliberately attacking medical personnel, humanitarian workers and other civilians are war crimes,” said Samira Hamidi.",https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/afghanistan-deliberate-killing-of-civilians-must-be-investigated-following-deadly-attacks/

Officials in the Afghan capital reported dual bomb attacks that killed at least seven people on June 12 as reports from the provinces said two more districts had fallen to Taliban militants.
In Kabul, at least two bombs struck minivans about 2 kilometers apart in a predominantly Hazara area in the west of the city, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.
There were at least six people wounded, in addition to the seven deaths initially confirmed, officials said.
A Kabul police spokesman, Firdous Framarz, told RFE/RL that both blasts were caused by so-called sticky bombs, which are attached to vehicles with magnetics.
No group claimed responsibility.

The same area has been the scene of at least four other attacks on minivans in the past month that have killed 18 people and were claimed by Islamic State (IS) militants. 
One of the explosions detonated in front of the Muhammad Ali Jinnah hospital, a center for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Reports of new fighting in the provinces on June 12 suggested the Taliban has now captured at least 10 districts among several provinces since May 1, when U.S. and other foreign forces officially began withdrawing from the decades-old conflict.
In western Ghor Province, a district chief in Tulak told Radio Free Afghanistan on June 12 that a Taliban attack had killed 19 security troops and wounded 20 more there.
Ghor's governor's office confirmed that communication with Tulak had been cut off since late morning on June 12 but did not say whether the town had been captured by militants.
But a source in Ghor's provincial administration who was not authorized to speak publicly on the events confirmed that the Taliban now controlled the district of Tulak. 
Government forces have withdrawn from the district and police headquarters, the same source said.

In the northern Afghan province of Balkh, local officials said Taliban fighters had captured the Zara district after a long siege that eventually forced government troops to evacuate the district headquarters.
Provincial councilor Afzal Hadid said the militants had blocked water supplies to the compound.
Differing reports said security forces had withdrawn or relocated the security forces but suggested there were no casualties on the government side.
Elsewhere, reports said Taliban fighters launched large-scale attacks on two districts of northern Kunduz Province. 
A police spokesman in Kunduz said the attacks had been repelled in fighting that left one Afghan soldier dead and 27 Taliban militants dead. 
A spokesman for the Afghan National Army's Shaheen Corps in the north of the country told RFE/RL on June 12 that at least 20 Taliban insurgents had been killed by air strikes in the Balkh, Dawlatabad, and Chamtal districts.
The dead included a Taliban commander known as Mullah Delawar, the spokesman said.
Another Afghan corps reported that 47 Taliban militants were killed in an operation in the Andar district of Ghazni Province late on June 11. 
Radio Free Afghanistan could not immediately confirm the casualty reports on either side.

With violence raging, there is concern the departure of foreign forces could lead to the collapse of the government in Kabul and return of the Taliban to power.
One high priority is securing Kabul's international airport to ensure diplomatic and humanitarian work can continue in the country. 
The Taliban has reportedly rejected NATO member Turkey's proposal to guard and run the airport after other U.S.-led NATO forces depart.
A Taliban spokesman said on June 10 that Turkey should withdraw its troops from Afghanistan together with all other international forces. 
Under the February 2020 deal secured with the Taliban under former President Donald Trump, all U.S. forces and NATO forces were to be out of Afghanistan by May 1.
U.S. President Joe Biden pushed back the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops to September, citing logistical complications of leaving earlier.

A suicide bomber attacked a police checkpoint in the Afghan capital Friday, killing at least nine people and wounding 18, officials said. Islamic State militants claimed responsibility. The attack took place near a gathering commemorating the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, a leader of the mainly Shia Hazara community in Afghanistan who was killed by the Taliban in 1995. As NPR's Diaa Hadid reports from Islamabad, ""Images from the scene showed men sprawled on the ground. The body of one man was badly mangled around metal bars."" At least one policeman and six civilians were among the dead and 15 civilians wounded in the Mosalla-e-Mazari area of Kabul, Najib Danesh, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. A spokesman for the Kabul police chief said the bomber was stopped at the checkpoint near the gathering when he detonated explosives.

At Least Nine Dead In Kabul Suicide Bombing

An Islamic State (IS) suicide bomber blew himself up in Kabul's Shi'ite area on March 9, killing at least nine people, officials said.
One police officer was among those killed in the attack, which occurred near a gathering to mark the 23rd anniversary of the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, a prominent former leader of the mainly Shi'ite Hazara ethnic community who was killed by the Taliban.
Afghan Interior Ministry deputy spokesperson Nusrat Rahimi told RFE/RL that at least nine people were killed and 18 others were wounded in the attack. 
The IS group in a statement posted on an IS-affiliated website said it was behind the Kabul attack. The claim says IS targeted a gathering of Shi'ites as they were commemorating the death of a ""tyrant.""
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack in a statement, promising that those behind the attack would be given the death penalty, if found and convicted.
Kabul police chief Mohammad Daud Amin told Afghan news outlet Tolo News that the bomber detonated his explosive device at a checkpoint ""after being identified by police.""
""The bomber failed to get inside to target the gathering,"" Amin said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. 
Afghanistan's minority Shi'ites, who are mostly Hazaras, have lately been frequently targeted in militant attacks, either by the Taliban or the Islamic State group.
Sunni militants consider the Shi'ites heretics and urge followers to kill them.
The March 9 attack comes a week after a car bomb exploded near a passing Australian Embassy convoy in eastern Kabul, killing at least one child and wounding several other people.
Kabul is one of the deadliest places in Afghanistan for civilians. Since mid-January, militants have stormed a hotel, bombed a crowded commercial street, raided a military compound, and launched a suicide attack during morning rush hour, killing more than 130 people.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani at an international conference in Kabul last week unveiled a plan to open talks with the Taliban.
In return, Ghani said the militants should officially recognize the Afghan government and constitution.
""The offer of negotiation is on the table,"" UN envoy to Afghanistan Tadamichi Yamamoto told a Security Council meeting on March 8.
The United States has also called on the insurgents to consider the offer of peace talks.
Before Ghani's offer, the Taliban had called for direct talks with Washington.

The incident on Saturday took place in Dasht-e Barchi, a Kabul suburb dominated by members of the mostly Shia Hazara community, who for years have been targeted by ISIL-affiliated fighters.
The Afghan Journalists Center said the person killed in the blast was Hamid Seighani, a well-known Afghan journalist who used to work for the Ariana television network.
â€œUnfortunately, we lost another reporter,â€ the centre tweeted hours after the blast.
There was no claim of responsibility.
The driver of the vehicle, speaking to the Associated Press news agency at the hospital, said that at one point during his route, a suspicious man got onto the bus and a few minutes later, the explosion went off at the back of it.
He saw two passengers with their clothes on fire falling out of the back of the vehicle while other passengers escaped out of the front.
â€œI was in my car and an explosion happened in the vehicle in front of us,â€ a witness told AFP news agency. â€œIt was completely burnt.â€
He said the explosion occurred near a checkpoint manned by the Taliban, and that gunfire could be heard briefly immediately afterwards. A nearby hospital posted a notice saying it had admitted one dead and four injured.

Taliban spokesman Zabihulla Mujahid tweeted that one person had been killed and two wounded after a fire broke out in a minibus and resulted in an explosion.
Images shared on social media on Saturday showed flames and a thick cloud of black smoke spiralling into the sky.
The explosion came a day after at least three people were killed and 15 wounded by a bomb at a mosque in Nangarhar.
In a statement, the Nangarhar governorâ€™s office said officials had arrested two â€œperpetratorsâ€ of the mosque bombing, but provided no other details. No group has claimed responsibility for the Nangarhar attack.
â€œFurther investigation into the incident is ongoing and more actions will be taken,â€ the statement said.
While Kabul has largely been free of ISIL (ISIS) since the Taliban takeover in August, in one recent attack ISIL fighters raided the cityâ€™s National Military Hospital, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 50.

KABUL, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- At least one civilian was killed and four others wounded when an explosion struck a bus on a busy road in the western part of Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Saturday, according to multiple sources.
""We heard a huge blast in the minibus carrying commuters in Mahtab Qala locality of Dashti Bari area. The whole place has now been sealed off by the Taliban security forces,"" an eyewitness told Xinhua.
The vehicle caught fire, sending a column of thick smoke into the sky and triggering panic, the witness said.

A bomb attack on a minivan in a Shi'ite neighborhood of Kabul has killed a well-known Afghan television journalist, according to an Afghan media watchdog and the journalist's wife.
The Afghan Journalists' Center tweeted hours after the November 13 blast in western Kabul's Dasht-e Barchi neighborhood that the explosion had killed Hamid Seighani, who worked for the Ariana television network.
Seighani's wife, who is also a journalist, confirmed his death in a Facebook post, saying, ""I have lost Hamid.""
Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman, said the blast caused a fire in Dasht-e Barchi. He said at least one civilian was killed. Mujahid said an investigation by the Taliban was under way.
Residents of the Dasht-e Barchi neighborhood confirmed hearing an explosion and seeing a vehicle burning after the blast.
A local man who gave his name as Ismael said he helped carry wounded people to a nearby hospital. He said at least three people were killed.
There was no confirmation of casualty numbers from hospital workers and no immediate claim of responsibility.
But the director of a nearby hospital who specializes in burn cases said at least two people suffered serious burn injuries.
Dr. Hakim Nasir Khesrow Balkhi said two wounded people were in critical condition when they were admitted to the hospital.
The bus driver, who goes by the single name Murtaza, told the AP at the hospital that a suspicious man got onto the vehicle a few minutes before an explosion went off at the back of the bus.
The driver said he saw two passengers with their clothes on fire falling out of the back of the vehicle. He said other passengers escaped out the front.
The Dasht-e Barchi area is heavily populated by Shi'ite ethnic Hazara, who have been the target of repeated attacks by Islamic State militants -- including a bomb attack on May 12, 2020, at the maternity ward of the local hospital that killed 24 people.
The latest attack came a day after a bomb exploded inside a Sunni mosque in Afghanistan's eastern province of Nangarhar.
That blast, which killed at least three people, occurred during Friday Prayers at the village mosque of Tarela in the Spin Ghar district.
The office of Nangarhar's Taliban-appointed governor issued a statement on November 13 saying that two ""perpetrators"" were arrested in connection with the mosque attack. It did not provide further details about the suspects.
""Further investigation into the incident is ongoing and more actions will be taken,"" the statement said.

ISLAMABAD â€”Â 
Officials, relatives and a media watchdog in Afghanistan confirmed Saturday that a suspected bomb blast on a minibus in Kabul had killed a well-known journalist and injured several people. 
The violence happened near a Taliban checkpoint in the Afghan capitalâ€™s western Dasht-e Barchi area, dominated by members of the minority Shiite Hazara community.
The slain journalist was identified as Hamid Saighani, who worked for the mainstream Ariana television network.
â€œYet another journalist killed in Afghanistan,â€ tweeted Afghanistan Journalists Center, an independent local media monitor, hours after the blast. It noted that Saighani was at least the ninth journalist killed in Afghanistan this year. 








Saighaniâ€™s wife, Fawzia Wahdat, also a journalist, posted ""I lost Hamid"" on her Facebook page.
Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief spokesman for the acting Taliban government, tweeted that one person had been killed and two injured. He said an investigation was underway. 
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attack, but Afghan Hazara have for years been the target of deadly violence by the regional Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-Khorasan). 
The terror group has intensified bombings and other attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in mid-August. 
Representatives of the acting Taliban government earlier this week claimed that an ongoing counterterror operation has captured around 600 IS-Khorasan militants and killed more than three dozen in the last three months. 
Data from the local media group Afghan Journalists Safety Committee says at least 67 journalists were killed in Afghanistan between 2013 and 2020, for which the Taliban is listed as responsible for 27 cases. 
It is not known whether Saighani may have been the intended target of Saturdayâ€™s attack.

An investigation was under way, he added.A bomb attack on a school in the district took place earlier this year, before the coalition withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban's subsequent takeover.

Officials at Afghanistanâ€™s Ministry of Interior (MoI) confirmed that the explosion near Massoud Square on Tuesday was caused by a suicide attacker, and that it detonated close to one of the Ministry of Defenseâ€™s buildings in Police District 9 (PD9) in the city of Kabul.
According to a Ministry of Interior statement, at least 22 civilians were killed and 38 others were wounded in the blast, including women and children.
The blast occurred shortly after 1 p.m.
The Taliban have claimed responsibility.Â 
â€œThe Taliban terrorists have sustained major blows by the brave members of the Afghan security and defense forces on the battlefield, and they face shameful setbacks on every front, so they plan brutal and chaos-causing attacks on civilians,â€ the Ministry of Interior statement said.

Dasht-e-Barchi is largely populated by the mostly Shia Hazara community, which for years has been the target of violence by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, ISKP (ISIS-K), an affiliate of the ISIL (ISIS) armed group.
In November, a similar bomb attack on a minibus in Dasht-e-Barchi killed two people and wounded five others. That attack was claimed by the ISKP.
The ISKP claimed an October suicide attack on a Shia mosque in Kandahar in which at least 60 people were killed and scores others injured.
That attack came a week after another deadly mosque blast claimed by the group in northern Kunduz province killed more than 60 people.
 




 


 
The Taliban has promised to crack down on the armed group, attacking their hideouts, especially in the countryâ€™s south and east.
Fridayâ€™s bus blast is the first fatal attack in several weeks.
The Taliban returned to power in August, 20 years after it was toppled in a US-led military invasion in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The West-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani collapsed during the final stages of the withdrawal of US troops in August.

Two people were killed and four others injured in separate bomb explosions Friday in Kabul, the interim Taliban government said, as the Daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility. ""Two civilians have been killed and three others were wounded"" when a bomb exploded on a minibus in the Dasht-e-Barchi district of the Afghan capital, the Taliban's interior ministry spokesperson Sayed Khosti told reporters.
 ""In another explosion in the same area, one woman was wounded,"" he added, specifying that the second blast was also a bomb. Dasht-e-Barchi is dominated by the Shiite Hazara community, who for years has been the target of violence by the Daesh-Khorasan Province (Daesh-K).
 The Daesh-K late Friday claimed responsibility for what it said were three explosions targeting buses carrying Shiites. The bombings ended up ""destroying the buses and killing and wounding dozens of them,"" according to the group's message translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, a platform that monitors terrorist activity. Broken glass and mangled vehicles were seen near the spot, where one of the explosions occurred. In November, a similar bomb attack on a minibus in Dasht-e-Barchi killed two people and wounded five others in an attack that also was claimed by Daesh-K.
 Daesh-K terrorist group, which is an offshoot of the Daesh that established a so-called caliphate across swathes of Iraq and Syria from 2014 until 2017, also claimed responsibility for an Oct. 15 suicide bomb attack on a Shiite mosque in Kandahar that killed at least 60 people and injured scores more. That attack came a week after another deadly mosque blast claimed by the group in northern Kunduz province killed over 60 people. The Taliban has vowed to crush this rival Sunni terrorist group, launching crackdowns against hideouts used by the terrorists, especially in the country's south and east. Friday's bus bombings included the first fatal attack reported by the Taliban for several weeks. But Kabul has been hit by repeated blasts lately that the Taliban say have been non-fatal. The Taliban took control after a two-decade absence on Aug. 15, when the previous government's resistance melted amid the final stages of the United States military withdrawal from the country. The Taliban's first stint in power lasted from 1996 to 2001, before the U.S. invasion toppled it.
