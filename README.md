3-	Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part
4-	Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
5-	Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group

If we have a review to the terrorist attacks news in Afghanistan we will get this point which most of these events occur in Hazara ethnicity living area.Hazara is one of Afghanistan ethnicity with different race and religious which is Shia. as this ethnicity has been victim of genocide by political leaders and kings during 18 century   , there is a hypothesis which says all of these systematic terrorist attacks and victims selection process by terrorist groups manage by aim of Hazara Genocide. in this research,we are looking for some facts to prove or reject this hypothesis.
